**The Trophy Puzzle: A Symbol of Triumph and Teamwork**

Every team entering the EWC receives a unique, physical piece of the championship trophy, a tangible representation of their potential for greatness. As the tournament unfolds, teams must relinquish their piece to the victors upon defeat, resulting in a dynamic where the trophy gradually assembles in the hands of the winning team. This symbolizes their dominance across multiple games and serves as a testament to their skill, perseverance, and collaborative spirit. 

For the defeated, losing their trophy piece is a tangible reminder of the challenges overcome and the battles yet to be won, fueling their determination for future success. The EWC's trophy puzzle concept not only adds a layer of excitement and drama to the competition but also embodies the essence of esports, where individual victories contribute to the collective success of a team.
