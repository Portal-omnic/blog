# VYSE: Abilities and Ultimate

[Valorant’s](https://playvalorant.com/en-us/) latest Sentinel, VYSE, is causing quite a stir in the community. Many players are underestimating just how powerful she can be, but once you dig into her abilities and potential use cases, it becomes clear that VYSE is set to be a game-changer. Between her versatile flash, unbreakable wall, and the ability to disable enemies’ weapons, VYSE brings a unique toolkit that could make her one of the most impactful agents in the game. Let’s break down why VYSE might be even stronger than you first thought.

## Arc Rose (E): A Flash Like No Other

VYSE’s signature ability, Arc Rose, is an ingenious flash mechanic that sets her apart from other agents. Unlike most flashes in Valorant, which require you to put away your weapon, Arc Rose allows VYSE to keep her gun out, maintaining full combat readiness. This alone makes the ability incredibly strong for both solo plays and team setups.

The flash can be placed on any surface and activated from anywhere on the map, making it a versatile tool for controlling the battlefield. The lack of an animation when activating the flash gives VYSE an advantage, allowing her to respond instantly to any threat. The Arc Rose flash is comparable to Breach’s flash in terms of windup time and duration, but with the added bonus of audio cues that indicate whether an enemy has been hit.

The cooldown on this ability is surprisingly low at just 20 seconds, and VYSE can even pick it up and redeploy it during the round. This ability's potential for information gathering and team coordination is immense, though it does have the slight drawback of being destructible if the enemy spots it early.

## Razorvine (C): Slowing Down the Competition

VYSE’s Razorvine is an area denial tool that slows and damages enemies who move through it. While it might not be the most powerful ability in her kit, it’s still highly useful for controlling key areas of the map. Razorvine can be placed strategically to slow down pushes or make it difficult for enemies to rotate.

This ability isn’t particularly strong in terms of damage, dealing only six damage per tick, but it excels at slowing down enemies, making it difficult for them to maneuver. Razorvine’s duration is quite long, lasting about 8 seconds with a total active time of 10 seconds including activation and fade times. While it may not be as impactful as a Sage slow or Chamber’s Trademark, Razorvine can still disrupt enemy movements and create opportunities for your team.

## Shear (Q): The Unbreakable Wall

Shear is VYSE’s most disruptive ability, capable of splitting enemy teams and creating advantageous situations for her allies. When an enemy crosses the trigger line, an indestructible wall rises, separating the enemy team or cutting off access to critical areas. The wall’s uptime is around 7 seconds, a significant amount of time in the fast-paced world of Valorant.

This ability shines in both offensive and defensive scenarios. On defense, it can slow down a push, giving your team time to rotate or set up. On offense, it can isolate an enemy, making it easier to pick them off or force them into unfavorable positions. The wall’s quick formation leaves little time for enemies to react, making it a reliable tool for controlling the flow of the game.

Shear is also incredibly cost-effective at just 200 credits, offering immense value for the price. Its versatility opens up numerous strategic possibilities, from blocking sightlines to trapping enemies in vulnerable positions.

## Steel Garden (X): The Ultimate Weapon Disabler

VYSE’s ultimate ability, Steel Garden, is a powerful tool that can turn the tide of a round. When activated, Steel Garden jams the primary weapons of all enemies within its radius, forcing them to rely on pistols for the duration of the effect. This ultimate is particularly devastating in eco rounds, where the enemy team might not have the firepower to deal with VYSE’s team effectively.

The ultimate lasts for several seconds and affects all enemies within a large area, making it ideal for site retakes or pushing a contested area. The long wind-up time gives enemies a brief window to prepare, but once the effect kicks in, it’s incredibly disruptive.

Steel Garden is especially useful in ranked play, where coordination might not be as tight. The ability to suddenly force enemies into a disadvantageous position can easily turn a losing round into a winning one.

## Conclusion: VYSE’s Potential is Massive

VYSE is an incredibly versatile and powerful agent who brings a fresh dynamic to Valorant’s Sentinel role. Her abilities offer a mix of crowd control, information gathering, and direct combat advantage, making her a valuable asset in any team composition. While it’s still early days and players are just beginning to explore her potential, it’s clear that VYSE is not to be underestimated. Whether you’re looking to disrupt enemy plays, gather crucial intel, or simply outgun your opponents, VYSE has the tools to make it happen.

As with any new agent, it’s important to keep an eye on how the meta evolves around VYSE. However, based on her kit, it’s likely that she will become a staple in many players’ arsenals. Don’t sleep on VYSE—she might just be the key to your next victory.
