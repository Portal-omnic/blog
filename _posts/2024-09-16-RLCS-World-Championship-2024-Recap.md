## Introduction

The [Rocket League Championship Series (RLCS) 2024 World Championship](https://liquipedia.net/rocketleague/Rocket_League_Championship_Series/2024) has concluded, and what a thrilling ride it was! Held at the iconic [Dickies Arena](https://dickiesarena.com/) in Fort Worth, Texas, from September 10th to 15th, the tournament brought together the top 16 [Rocket League](https://www.rocketleague.com/en) teams from around the globe. Fans witnessed intense matches, shocking upsets, and an epic grand final, proving once again why Rocket League is a dominant force in the esports world. Here’s a comprehensive breakdown of the tournament, including the new format, standout performances, and what made RLCS 2024 one for the history books.

## New Format and Structure of RLCS 2024

This year, the RLCS introduced a slightly tweaked format. While the [Swiss Stage](https://liquipedia.net/rocketleague/Rocket_League_Championship_Series/2024#Swiss_Stage) remained a staple, determining the top 8 teams through five best-of-five rounds, [Psyonix](https://www.psyonix.com/) introduced a new playoff structure called the "Hybrid Elimination Bracket." This format gave the top four teams from the Swiss Stage a significant advantage, allowing them two opportunities to make it to the finals. Meanwhile, teams seeded 5th-8th only had a single elimination chance, adding higher stakes to every match and rewarding top performance in the earlier rounds.

In contrast to previous years, where 24 teams participated, the RLCS 2024 featured a tighter roster of 16 qualified teams from various regions, including North America, Europe, South America, Middle East & North Africa, Oceania, Asia-Pacific, and Sub-Saharan Africa. This more focused selection increased the intensity of the competition, as every team had to fight through regional qualifiers and major events to secure a coveted spot at Worlds.

## Swiss Stage Overview: The Battle Begins

The tournament kicked off with the Swiss Stage, a highly regarded format known for its ability to thoroughly test teams' skills. This stage saw all 16 qualified teams pitted against each other in a bid to advance to the top 8. Matchups were determined based on previous win-loss records, ensuring that each round paired teams of similar strengths.

Some of the standout performances in the Swiss Stage came from North America's G2 Stride and Europe's Team BDS. G2 Stride, led by MVP player Beastmode, dominated their matchups and secured a high seeding heading into the playoffs. European teams such as Karmine Corp and Gentle Mates Alpine also showed strong gameplay, proving Europe's continued presence as a powerhouse in Rocket League.

## Playoffs: The Road to the Finals

The playoffs adopted the new Hybrid Elimination Bracket format, which immediately brought excitement and unpredictability to the tournament. The top four seeds had two chances to make it to the finals, while seeds 5-8 had just one shot, creating high-pressure situations.

The playoff rounds were filled with breathtaking matches and numerous overtimes. G2 Stride and Team BDS continued to assert their dominance, but other teams like FURIA Esports and Team Falcons gave them a run for their money. One of the most nail-biting matchups was between Karmine Corp and G2 Stride, where G2 almost suffered a reverse sweep but managed to secure their spot in the finals.

## Grand Final: Team BDS vs. G2 Stride

The grand final showdown between Team BDS and G2 Stride lived up to the hype. G2 Stride kicked off the series with an explosive performance, securing a 5-0 win in Game 1. However, Team BDS quickly adapted, showcasing remarkable strategy and mechanical prowess. As the series progressed, BDS found their rhythm, winning several crucial games and sealing the tournament victory with a final 4-2 scoreline.

Team BDS’s triumph in the grand finals marked their exceptional journey throughout the tournament. The team took home the championship trophy along with the grand prize of $300,000. G2 Stride, while falling short in the final match, earned a well-deserved $150,000 for their outstanding performance.

## Memorable Moments and Key Takeaways

1. **Beastmode and G2 Stride's Dominance:** G2 Stride, powered by star player Beastmode, made an impressive run through the tournament. Beastmode's LAN performance and strategic gameplay were critical in taking G2 to the finals, reinforcing North America's strong presence in Rocket League esports.

2. **The Swiss Stage Test:** The Swiss Stage once again proved to be a rigorous test for the teams. This format helped identify the best performers and set the stage for a dramatic playoff run, highlighting the strength of the tournament's structure.

3. **Minor Regions Rising:** Teams from regions like the Middle East & North Africa and South America showed their potential by competing head-to-head with the best in the world. FURIA Esports, from South America, managed to upset previous World Champions, Team Vitality, in the quarterfinals, signaling a promising future for minor regions.

4. **Team BDS's Resurgence:** After a disappointing performance at the London Major earlier in the year, Team BDS bounced back at the World Championship, proving their resilience and solidifying their position as one of the top teams in Rocket League.

## Conclusion

The RLCS 2024 World Championship was a thrilling spectacle that showcased the highest level of Rocket League competition. From the new playoff format to the unexpected upsets and legendary plays, the tournament delivered an action-packed week for fans and players alike. Team BDS's victory not only crowned them champions but also set the stage for an exciting future in Rocket League esports.
