Greetings, dear readers, followers, fans, and people who accidentally clicked on our link thinking we were selling robotic vacuum cleaners. Today, we have some shockingly original news to share. Brace yourself: we have rebranded. Yes, that's right. We didn't just go on a summer break and come back with a new hairstyle. We have had a full makeover, darling!

Before you start hyperventilating (because let’s face it, everyone’s life revolved around Omnic Data’s name), let me introduce you to our new and shiny name: [Omnic.AI](https://www.omnic.ai/). Ooh, ahh!

Now, why the change? It's not just because we fancied a spritz of corporate cologne. We decided to take our obsession with AI up a notch. When people see our brand, we don’t want them thinking about spreadsheets or some mundane pie charts. We want them to scream (preferably not in public), “These folks are the [Michael Jordan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Jordan) of gaming AI!” Hence, "[Omnic.AI](https://www.omnic.ai/)" makes it pretty darn clear that AI is central to our core, our heart, and maybe even our questionable humor.

[Omnic.AI](https://www.omnic.ai/) isn't just a tool; it's THE AI-powered performance gaming tool. And for the uninitiated, no, it won’t make you a sandwich or fetch you a drink. But it WILL help you game smarter. We cater to everyone from esports celebs to the individual who swears they were just one click away from esports stardom (we see you, Jon from marketing).

Speaking of new and sassy things, have you seen our tagline's glow-up? Out with the old “Your AI Esports Coach” and in with the spiffy, “Game Smarter with AI.” Because, why simply game when you can game smarter? And let’s be real, who needs a coach when you have a futuristic, mind-blowing AI?

To clarify to all the skeptics out there: NO, we haven't just stuck a ".AI" to our name and called it a day. But YES, we are still the same slightly nerdy, massively awesome crew obsessed with giving you the best in gaming through AI. We're like that old friend from college who comes back from a semester abroad with an accent. A little different, a tad funnier, but essentially still your best bud.

To sum things up, welcome to [Omnic.AI](https://www.omnic.ai/)! It’s still us, just a bit more... AI-ish? Thanks for coming on this wild rebranding journey with us. Keep gaming, keep laughing, and always, always, Game Smarter with AI.

[Omnic.AI](https://www.omnic.ai/) is an AI-powered performance gaming tool designed to help you game smarter. Our technology provides resources for professional esports players, content creators, production teams and every day gamers to do what they love — faster and smarter through the power of AI.
