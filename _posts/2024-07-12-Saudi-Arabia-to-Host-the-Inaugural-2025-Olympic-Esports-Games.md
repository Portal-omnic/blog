The [International Olympic Committee (IOC)](https://olympics.com/ioc) has [announced](https://olympics.com/ioc/news/ioc-announces-olympic-esports-games-to-be-hosted-in-the-kingdom-of-saudi-arabia) that it has partnered with the National Olympic Committee (NOC) of Saudi Arabia to host the inaugural Olympic Esports Games 2025 in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. This is a major development for the esports industry, which has been campaigning for Olympic recognition for many years.

The first edition of the Olympic Esports Games will be held in 2025 and will be held every four years for the next twelve years. The details of which games will be featured are still being worked out, but the IOC has said that it will focus on games that are popular in Saudi Arabia and the Middle East.

The IOC is also aiming to create a separate branch focused on esports, which will be responsible for overseeing the Olympic Esports Games and other esports-related activities. The IOC will also look for different ways to fund the games, as they are not currently part of the traditional Olympic budget.

Saudi Arabia has [recently invested heavily in esports](https://www.sportico.com/business/sponsorship/2024/esports-investment-saudi-arabia-1234770868/), and the country is home to a number of major esports organizations and events. The Saudi government is also a strong supporter of the Olympic Games, and it is hoped that the inclusion of esports will help to boost the country's image on the world stage.

However, the Saudi government's human rights record is controversial, and some people have expressed concerns about the inclusion of esports in the Olympic Games. The IOC has said that it will work with the Saudi government to ensure that the games are held in a fair and inclusive manner, but it remains to be seen whether this will be possible.

Overall, the inclusion of esports in the Olympic Games is a major development for the industry. It is a sign of the growing popularity of esports and its increasing recognition as a legitimate sport. However, there are also some concerns about the inclusion of esports in the Olympic Games, such as the human rights record of the host country.
