**Here's What You Missed**

The Swiss Bracket's opening duo of days delivered enthralling performances that could only be described as electric. Let's delve into how the teams are shaping up:

The Undefeated Elites (2-0 Group):
Emerging as the tour de force, we have JDG, Gen.G, LNG, and to everyone's astonishment, G2! These powerhouses have showcased unparalleled dominance. While JDG and Gen.G are pegged as the heavyweights for the title, LNG's potential shouldn't be underestimated. And G2? They've stunned audiences with their exhilarating victory against Weibo. As we brace ourselves for the Bo3 clashes leading to the bracket stage, the Gen.G vs. G2 and JDG vs. LNG face-offs promise to be legendary.

The Balanced Battleground (1-1 Group):
This spectrum has an intriguing mix of squads, all with eyes set on the next phase. T1, Weibo, KT, and BLG stand out as the favorites for long-term impact. Yet, with Bo1s in play, there's room for some unexpected twists, giving teams from NA and EU a fair shot. Matches like NRG vs. MAD, KT vs. Weibo, and C9 vs. T1 are anticipated to be iconic showdowns. Don't miss them!

The Do-or-Die Contenders (0-2 Group):
These teams are on the edge, battling to retain their place in the championship. Dplus, despite their current standing, is perceived as a giant waiting to awaken and is expected to edge past BDS in the Bo3s. Meanwhile, Liquid seems to hold an upper hand against GAM. However, given the unpredictable nature of the championship so far, the next clash is anybody's game.
