**Derke's Take on Patch 7.04:**

- Drastic Changes: Derke humorously compares the agent balancing team to the VCT scheduling team, suggesting that both might be making too many changes simultaneously.
- Incremental Changes vs. Overhauls: He advocates for smaller, more incremental changes, fearing that massive adjustments might risk sidelining certain agents.
- Variety in Gameplay: Derke emphasizes the importance of variety in agent selection for gameplay. He feels the current changes might limit this diversity.
- Overlooking Agents: He points out that some agents, like Phoenix, seem to have been overlooked in the recent balance changes.

**Conclusion:**
