The [FNCS Major 1 Grand Finals](https://www.fortnite.com/competitive/news/fortnite-championship-series-2024-details) are dropping in hot on February 24th and 25th, 2024. This epic showdown will witness the best duos from across the globe battle it out for glory, a massive prize pool, and a chance to secure their spot in the prestigious FNCS Global Championship. So, mark your calendars, grab your snacks, and let's dive into everything you need to know:

**Tournament Format: A Climb to the Top**

The FNCS Major 1 journey started with players reaching Platinum I in Ranked Battle Royale. From there, they battled through Open Qualifiers, Upper and Lower Semi-Finals, and now, only the top 50 duos from each region (NA/EU and OCE/ASIA/ME/BR) stand on the brink of victory.

The Grand Finals are a two-day test of skill and endurance. Each day features six action-packed matches, where duos will eliminate opponents and strategize their way to the top. Remember, every point counts, so staying alive is crucial. But on Day 2, eliminations become worth 1.5x points, adding a whole new layer of excitement and potentially shaking up the leaderboard.

**Storylines to Watch: Legends Return, New Faces Rise**

Legends return: Witness the epic comeback of Aqua and the triumphant return of Mongraal, a duo known for their aggressive style.

New faces, fierce competition: Keep an eye on Fazer & Kng's debut in the EU finals, and watch established duos like Swizzy & Putrick and Hen & Vaske bring their unique strategies to the table.

**Prize Pool Fit for Champions**

The $7.65 million prize pool is divided across FNCS Major’s 1, 2 & 3, with the winning duo taking home a significant portion and securing a coveted spot in the FNCS Global Championship. Remember, every placement matters, so the competition for every dollar will be fierce.
