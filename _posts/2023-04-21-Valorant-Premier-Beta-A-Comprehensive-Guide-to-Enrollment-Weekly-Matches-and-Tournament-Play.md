Prepare to showcase your skills in the new [Valorant Premier Beta](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5d0ZoVqrWuo) feature beginning next Tuesday, April 25th! This guide will recap everything you need to know about enrollment, weekly matches, and tournament play so you don't miss out on this thrilling gaming experience!

**Enrollment**

Enrollment for the Valorant Premier Beta is open from April 25th to April 28th. Any player can enroll, provided they meet the following requirements:

- Been ranked at some point in the account's career, which means completing 5 placement [Competitive games](https://support-valorant.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/360047937633-VALORANT-Competitive-Mode-FAQ). Brand new players will need to level up their account to level 20 before accessing Competitive play.

- SMS verify their account. This option will be available during the Premier sign-up process, so keep your phone handy.

Players can create or join a team consisting of 5 to 7 players. Each player can be a part of only one team. Players of any skill level can be on the same team, but teams will be placed into divisions based on the top 5 players' cumulative [MMR](https://www.rivalry.com/news/valorant-mmr-everything-you-need-to-know). Inviting a player of significantly higher or lower skill that moves the team out of the division it is currently in will fail; you will have to unenroll the team and re-enroll to play with that player.

Team Owners, whoever initially created the team, manage the roster, including canceling invites and removing players from the team. Rosters are set once weekly matches begin on April 29th, so make sure you have your team finalized before then. Team Owners also select the zone where the team's matches will be played which determines in what region your matches will be played and at what times. Owners can see the zones with the best average [ping](https://support-valorant.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/360055678634-Server-Select) when selecting to pick what’s best for their team. Matches will be played on the same latency rules as competitive, so no team will get an inherent advantage.

**Important:** If you miss enrollment, you won't be able to participate in the beta!

**Weekly Matches**

Weekly matches run from April 29th to May 20th with 1 to 2 matches per week. Each match will be against a team in your division on that week’s featured map in the Premier hub, from which you also queue as a team for matches. There is a time window for teams to queue for matches each week and it's best to queue early in the window for optimal results. Queues shouldn’t take longer than 8 minutes, but queuing later in the window could result in longer queues or not finding a match.

Matches play out like regular competitive games, except for overtime. In Overtime, the first team to reach 12 points picks the starting side. Teams must win by 2 points and swap sides each round. If 2 sets of Overtime have been played and the score is still tied, a final Sudden Death round is played (the first team to 12 points chooses their starting side). 

Winning a match earns 100 points, losing earns 25 points, and not queuing or playing earns 0 points.

**Tournament Play**

Teams that accrue 375 points over their weekly matches qualify for the tournament. All qualifying teams in a division will be matched into a bracket of 8 teams. Brackets are Bo1 (best of one), with one winner emerging from each bracket. Losing teams enter the consolation bracket for 3rd place.

During the tournament, before a match teams take turns picking and banning maps, similar to professional play. The process alternates between the teams until a map is chosen; the team that didn't choose the map decides whether to attack or defend first.

Bracket winners will earn a unique player card and title. All Premier participants will also receive a player card and title after the beta ends. Rewards can be redeemed the day after winning or when the beta ends in the collections screen.

Grab your friends and get ready for some fun matches! This guide should get you up and running, but you can check out the [Valorant Premier](https://playvalorant.com/en-us/news/game-updates/premier-global-open-beta-faq/) FAQ for more information. Good luck, and may the best team win!
