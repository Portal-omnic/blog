Today kicks off the [first open qualifier](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d513E3-iWcg) where [256 aspiring Valorant teams](https://battlefy.com/knights-%E2%9C%A8/valorant-challengers-north-america-open-qualifier/63ab512f34bf4f70da185476/participants) are competing to earn a spot in Challengers and hopefully earn a franchised spot in the international leagues. But an aspiring team has a long way to go, so today we’ll break down the path to get there.

**Open Qualifier**

For the majority of teams, their ticket into Challengers would come from successful bid at one of two open tournaments happening this January. [From the 9th to the 13th and the 17th to the 23rd](https://valorantesports.com/news/everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-challengers-series-open-qualifiers/en-us), teams have the chance to earn one of 6 spots into Challengers [(4 from the first tournament, 2 from the second)](https://www.dexerto.com/valorant/na-valorant-challengers-league-schedule-teams-and-how-to-watch-2019056/). For each tournament, the team plays through a 3-round single-elimination bracket before the remaining teams are reseeded into a 32-team, double-elimination bracket where the winners earn the slots. (Of course, if you were invited, you skip this step [like G2, TSM, FaZe, M80, The Guard, & Shopify Rebellion](https://twitter.com/KnightsArena/status/1611878850966724614) in NA Challengers).

**Challengers**

After a team wins a slot to [challengers](https://www.sportskeeda.com/valorant/valorant-challengers-league-2023-open-qualifiers-format-schedule), the hard work really begins. Challengers consist of 12 teams battling it out across a [regular split, a mid-season tournament, and a second regular split](https://www.dexerto.com/valorant/na-valorant-challengers-league-schedule-teams-and-how-to-watch-2019056/). Scoring points based on their performance at each step, the top 8 teams move into the playoffs, from which the top 2 move on to the Ascension tournament. 

**Ascension Tournament**

The final step for any aspiring team, the [Ascension Tournament](https://www.sportskeeda.com/valorant/valorant-ascension-league-expected-start-date-participating-teams-and-more-revealed) is a global competition where the best challengers teams from across the world meet to compete for a franchise spot in the global league. The best-performing team for each region ([Americas, EMEA, & Pacific](https://valorantesports.com/vct-teams)) will win the ascension slot for that region and become the 11th global team in each region.

If your favorite team doesn’t ascend this year, don’t fret: Riot intends to ascend a team every year for the foreseeable future, and the new in-game competitive system that is coming down the line will make it easier for new teams to rise to the top.
