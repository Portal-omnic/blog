**The Home Stretch**

Yesterday kicked off the year's [third and final Fortnite Champion Series (FNCS) Major](https://www.fortnite.com/competitive/news/fncs-major-3-and-last-chance-major-competitive-details). The best duos will compete in each of the major regions to earn spots in the [FNCS Global Championship in Copenhagen](https://competitive.fortnite.com/2023fncsgc). We have all the details to tune in for what promises to be an epic event!

**Event Details**

The Major has 3 weeks of weekly competition (Thursday till Saturday). The dates are:

- Week 1: Thursday July 20th, Friday July 21st, Saturday July 22nd
- Week 2: Thursday July 27th, Friday July 28th, Saturday July 29th
- Week 3: Thursday August 3rd, Friday August 4th, Saturday August 5th

The finals of each week (Saturday the 22nd, 29th, and 5th) will be broadcasted, starting at 8 PM EST.

The best teams that qualify move on to the Grand Finals on August 12th and 13th where the Major’s winners will be crowned after 12 matches; broadcasting for both days starts at 8 PM EST as well.

**Scoring Breakdown**

The new scoring system gives players more ways to rack up points. Teams will earn points for:

- Victory Royale: 30 Points
- 2nd: 25 Points
- 3rd-4th: 20 Points
- 5th-6th: 15 Points
- 7th-8th: 10 Points
- 9th-12th: 5 Points

Each elimination will be worth 2 Points, and players will receive bonus points for being the first team to open a vault or capture the rifting-in POI.

**More Ways to Score**

This Major brings a new twist to the scene as teams have new ways to earn points. In addition to victory royales and eliminations, teams will also score points for opening a vault on the map or capturing the rifting-in POI (not normal POIs).

This will create interesting opportunities for teams to play for specific spots on the map. We may see more early action as players have incentives for clashing over objectives rather than waiting until the storm circle forces teams to fight.

**Potential Favorites**

While we can't predict who will win, we can certainly highlight some of the potential favorites. Players such as [Bugha](https://twitter.com/bugha), [Clix](https://twitter.com/Clix), and [Mitr0](https://twitter.com/mitr0) have shown consistently strong performances and could be contenders to watch out for.

**One Last Chance**

After this major, most of the remaining spots in Copenhagen will be filled up, but players who don’t make it shouldn’t despair. There is a Last Chance Major in August for players to punch their tickets to the FNCS finals.

**How to Watch**

Fans can watch the competition live on the official Fortnite [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@fortnite) and [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/fortnite) channels, as well as on the [Fortnite website](https://www.fortnite.com/competitive). Make sure to subscribe or follow these channels for notifications when the matches go live.

**FNCS Major 3 Prizes**

The prize pool for the FNCS Major 3 is a whopping $3 million, with the winning team taking home a considerable chunk of that sum. There are also substantial prizes for teams that manage to place in the top 50, providing further motivation for the competitors.
