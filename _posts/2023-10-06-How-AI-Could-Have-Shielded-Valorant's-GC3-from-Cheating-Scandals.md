The [recent controversy](https://www.esports.net/news/valorant/valorant-game-changers-noot-noot-disqualified/) surrounding the [Valorant](https://playvalorant.com/en-us/) Game Changers team, [Noot Noot](https://www.vlr.gg/team/11689/noot-noot), is a stark reminder that cheating remains an ever-present threat in the realm of esports. While Riot’s Anti-Cheat successfully detected foul play in this instance, the revelation raised broader questions. How many more such incidents go unnoticed? Could the integration of more advanced AI technologies, like computer vision and analytical analysis, provide a stronger safeguard against cheating?

**Real-time Computer Vision Monitoring**

Computer vision is a subset of AI, enabling machines to interpret and act upon visual data. In the esports context, computer vision can be employed to monitor gameplay in real-time, looking for discrepancies or abnormal patterns that might indicate foul play.

Imagine an AI system that continually scans player screens, comparing in-game actions with standard gameplay patterns. Such a system could detect anomalies, like inhuman reaction times or accuracy, flagging them for review. This kind of real-time monitoring can act as a deterrent and provide an added layer of assurance to both players and fans.

**Advanced Analytical Analysis of Game Data**

By combining detailed gameplay data with advanced analytical algorithms, AI can provide insights beyond human capabilities. Analyzing player behavior, movement patterns, and decision-making processes can help identify outliers that may not be evident at first glance.

For instance, a player might consistently have knowledge of enemy positions without any in-game cues, pointing towards possible wall-hacking. A sophisticated AI would be able to detect these subtle patterns and raise alarms before they affect the outcome of a game.

**Player Profiling with Machine Learning**

Machine learning models can be trained to understand a player’s unique style, including their habits, strategies, and reaction times. By continuously updating this profile with new gameplay data, the system can alert officials if a player suddenly deviates significantly from their typical behavior.

In the case of Noot Noot’s player, malibu, a detailed profile might have provided early indications of irregular gameplay patterns, potentially even before the Riot Anti-Cheat detected the cheat.

**Transparent and Immediate Feedback**

With the power of AI, feedback about suspicious activities can be immediate. This rapid response can reduce long intermissions, like the two-hour pause during the Noot Noot and Complexity GX3 match. Prompt feedback can help maintain the flow of the game, ensuring a better experience for both players and spectators.

**Conclusion**

While no system can be entirely foolproof, the integration of AI, through computer vision and advanced analytics, promises to elevate the standards of fair play in esports. Beyond just detection, these tools can act as deterrents, signaling to potential cheaters that their chances of going undetected are minuscule. As esports continues its meteoric rise in global popularity, leveraging technology to maintain the integrity of the game will be paramount.
