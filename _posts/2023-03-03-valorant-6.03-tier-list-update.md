As [Lock//in](https://liquipedia.net/valorant/VCT/2023/LOCK_IN_S%C3%A3o_Paulo) 2023 comes to a close and [6.03](https://playvalorant.com/en-us/news/game-updates/valorant-patch-notes-6-03/) has had some time to sink in, it’s time to update our tier lists to reflect the changes in the meta. 

As a reminder:
S - Near must pick, offers a clear advantage over the others
A - Very good pick that still offers a lot
B - Okay pick that can work in some situations
C - Less successful pick that will usually struggle

**Sentinels**

Killjoy gets bumped down due to the [6.03](https://playvalorant.com/en-us/news/game-updates/valorant-patch-notes-6-03/) nerfs, as the weaker turret and more expensive ult reduce her clear dominance over other sentinels. Sage and Cypher remain solid picks and both have seen time on the stage in São Paulo. Another looming presence is the return of Chamber; Killjoy’s drop in power and Lotus’s close-quarter design has made the French agent more viable, although he still feels the effects of his nerf that prevents him from dominating again.

![Duelists Tier List](/2023-03-03-valorant-6.03-tier-list-update-duelist.png)

**Duelists**

Jett now sits alone at the top as Raze’s BoomBot nerfs in [6.03](https://playvalorant.com/en-us/news/game-updates/valorant-patch-notes-6-03/) turn her into a simply solid pick (but don’t let that fool you as she remains very strong). Phoenix and Neon have seen some time on the stage and remain good options. Reyna remains the “smurf agent” that is dominant when a player has excellent aim but struggles otherwise. Yoru moves up to the plausible tier with a few appearances in Challengers and São Paulo but is still a mechanically challenging and situational pick.

![Controllers Tier List](/2023-03-03-valorant-6.03-tier-list-update-controller.png)

**Controllers**

Not much changed for the controller role. The top three of Viper, Omen, and Brimstone remain solid picks on any map, even must-picks on some. Astra has shown strong performances in pro play, but still isn’t reliable enough to be a solid overall pick. Harbor has been a big surprise in Lock//in and has seen a lot of usage on Pearl in particular. He may not be as bad as originally thought, but he is still a situational pick.

![Initiators Tier List](/2023-03-03-valorant-6.03-tier-list-update-initiator.png)

**Initiators**

Not much to say here. Sova remains king because of his synergy with Jett and Shock Bolts are now more effective against Killjoy’s weaker turret. KAY/O and Fade remain where they are due to their varied utility. Breach and Skye remain where they are due to their kits being less varied.
