![Valorant Patch Notes 7.0](/2023-06-30-Valorant-Patch-7.0-Review.png)

[Valorant](https://playvalorant.com/en-us/) just received a massive update with 7.0 and there are a ton of new things. From a new agent to a new game mode to a new progression system, we have you covered with all the new stuff so you can jump right into the action!

**Deadlock - The Lockdown Sentinel**

Agent #22 is a Sentinel focused on locking down opponents' movements. [Deadlock’s](https://playvalorant.com/en-us/agents/deadlock/) signature ability is her Gravnet which will restrict any opponents it hits, forcing them to move slowly and crouch until they remove the net applied to them. Her Sonic Sensor watches an area and will concuss opponents that make noise (by walking or shooting) nearby. The Barrier Mesh blocks movement by allies and opponents and can only be removed by shooting the center “blob.” Lastly, her ultimate will capture the first opponent hit, trapping them in a cocoon. Other opponents can break the cocoon, but if it is pulled to the original location it will eliminate the trapped opponent.

Early impressions compare her to [Cypher](https://playvalorant.com/en-us/agents/cypher/) in her gameplay style, although she has more stopping power in holding an area. While she is unlikely to upset the meta, she could find some clever uses here and there.

We have included a summary of Deadlock’s abilities and ultimate below:

**Abilities**

GravNet

- EQUIP a GravNet grenade. FIRE to throw. ALT FIRE to lob the grenade underhand. The GravNet detonates upon landing, forcing any enemies caught within to crouch and move slowly.

- Uses 1, Creds 200, Windup 0.4s, Duration 6s, Debuff Forced crouch, 85% slow beyond AoE

Sonic Sensor

- EQUIP a Sonic Sensor. FIRE to deploy. The sensor monitors an area for enemies making sound. It concusses that area if footsteps, weapons fire, or significant noise are detected.

- Uses 2, Creds 200, Health 20 HP, Debuff 3.5s Concuss

Barrier Mesh

- EQUIP a Barrier Mesh disc. FIRE to throw forward. Upon landing, the disc generates barriers from the origin point that block character movement.

- Uses 1, Free, Windup 3s for fortification, Duration 30s, Health 320/680 HP, 570/1200 HP when fortified (Outer orbs/Central orb)

**Ultimate**

Annihilation

- EQUIP a Nanowire Accelerator. FIRE to unleash a pulse of nanowires that captures the first enemy contacted. The cocooned enemy is pulled along a nanowire path and will die if they reach the end, unless they are freed. The nanowire cocoon is destructible.

- 7 Points, Windup 1.1s, Duration 10s, Health 600 HP, Debuff 7s Cocoon

**Team Deathmatch - Warm Up Together**

The new act also brought a new game mode. [Team Deathmatch](https://playvalorant.com/en-us/news/game-updates/valorant-team-deathmatch-101/) pits two teams against each other in the race to 100 eliminations. Teams play through 4 rounds with stronger weapons each round. Abilities are on cooldowns and ultimates build slowly over time. Luckily, there are weapon pickups and ultimate charges that spawn on the map to speed up the process. 

It’s a great game mode to warm up in or play with friends, so try it out the next time you log on.

**Kingdom Come - Kingdom Credits**

The new act also introduced a new form of currency. [Kingdom credits](https://support-valorant.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/17511485643539-Kingdom-Credits-FAQ) are earned from playing the game and can be used to unlock agents and cosmetics from previous battle passes. You can get a boost from completing daily challenges that reward credits for every tier. 

The system should help make progress faster for new players as well as give veteran players the chance to catch up on any cosmetics they missed.

That’s the new act in a nutshell. Of course, a new act means a new ranked season, and if you want to climb to the top of your game, click [here](https://forge.omnic.ai/) and try out AI coaching first-hand for free.
