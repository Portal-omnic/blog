They give structure to competitive play, providing a sense of progression, achievement, and — of course — the thrill of climbing the ranks. But not all ranked modes are created equal. Some games excel in balancing skill and matchmaking, while others can be plagued by unfair ranking systems, harsh penalties, or limited rewards. Today, we’re diving into the ranked modes of some of the biggest competitive games, evaluating which ones offer the most fair, fun, and rewarding experience.1. Valorant: Teamwork and Tactical MasteryOverview:Riot Games’ Valorant ranks players based on a combination of individual and team performance. With ranks ranging from Iron to Radiant, players move up by winning games and achieving strong personal stats, like high kill-death ratios and effective utility usage.Strengths:Valorant’s ranked mode emphasizes strategy, teamwork, and skill, making it one of the more balanced systems. Riot has also invested heavily in detecting smurfs (higher-ranked players on lower-ranked accounts) and cheaters, keeping the experience fairer for everyone. The game’s “ranked distribution” system further ensures that only a small percentage of players reach the top tier, making the journey to Radiant a real achievement.Challenges:Despite these strengths, Valorant can sometimes feel punishing due to heavy team dependency. If you’re playing solo and match with players who aren’t as experienced or communicative, it can be difficult to win, potentially leading to frustrating rank losses. However, the introduction of a “premade team” indicator has made solo queueing slightly less intimidating.Fairness Rating: 4.5/5Valorant does an excellent job, but it’s highly dependent on teamwork, which can be a double-edged sword.2. Rocket League: Pure Skill in a High-Speed ArenaOverview:Rocket League’s ranked mode, by Psyonix, is streamlined and straightforward. Players climb through ranks from Bronze to Supersonic Legend based almost purely on their win/loss record in a fast-paced, 3v3 format.Strengths:The simplicity of Rocket League’s ranking system is its strength. There are no complicated factors or role-specific metrics; winning and improving your mechanical skills are all that matter. Additionally, Rocket League allows solo, duo, and team queues, giving players more flexibility to find the best experience for their playstyle.Challenges:One downside is the challenge of climbing when playing with a team, as Rocket League can be unforgiving if teammates aren’t on the same skill level. Without any form of role selection or positional preference, it can also be challenging to maintain consistency, especially at higher ranks where coordination becomes essential.Fairness Rating: 5/5With a low barrier for entry and an intuitive progression system, Rocket League offers one of the fairest ranked experiences around.3. Fortnite: A Battle Royale with Competitive DepthOverview:Epic Games introduced a ranked mode to Fortnite, allowing players to compete in Bronze through Unreal ranks, which focus on both combat skill and placement. The rank progression is based on a mix of eliminations and survival, giving players multiple paths to climb the ranks.Strengths:Fortnite’s ranked mode is great for players who enjoy a balanced challenge between fighting and strategic survival. Because the system rewards both eliminations and final placements, players with diverse playstyles can still succeed. Additionally, with the seasonal rank resets, there’s always a fresh start for players each season.Challenges:Ranked Fortnite can be challenging for team players who are up against well-coordinated teams, especially in higher ranks. And while it reduces some randomness compared to typical battle royale matches, the RNG (random number generator) of loot spawns still impacts fairness, particularly in early-game situations where players are scrambling for items.Fairness Rating: 4/5Fortnite balances combat and strategy well, but the reliance on loot RNG and team dynamics can sometimes affect fairness, especially in higher-stakes matches.4. Overwatch 2: Role Queues and FlexibilityOverview:Blizzard’s Overwatch 2 recently introduced several changes to its ranked mode, including a role queue system that allows players to select their preferred roles (Tank, Damage, or Support). This approach keeps matches more balanced and lets players focus on their strengths.Strengths:The role queue system is a significant advantage, ensuring that teams are well-rounded and reducing the chaos of all players gravitating toward damage roles. Overwatch 2 also rewards flexibility, with a separate “open queue” mode for those who prefer a more traditional experience without role restrictions.Challenges:Despite these improvements, the ranked experience in Overwatch 2 can be uneven due to a heavy reliance on team coordination. A single player performing poorly can heavily impact the match outcome, which can be frustrating if you’re playing solo.Fairness Rating: 3.5/5The role queue is a great addition, but team dependency can make the system feel unbalanced for those without consistent teammates.Conclusion: Which Ranked Mode Reigns Supreme?After comparing these games, Rocket League stands out for its simple, skill-based progression system that is accessible to both solo players and teams. However, Valorant and Fortnite also offer strong experiences, especially for those who thrive in a team environment and appreciate a blend of individual skill and strategy.Ultimately, the “best” ranked mode depends on your preferences. If you value solo progression, Rocket League might be your top choice. If you love strategy and team play, Valorant or Fortnite could be your go-to. Whatever your playstyle, these ranked systems each bring unique elements to the table, catering to players at every level of skill and competition.Omnic.AI is an AI-powered performance gaming tool designed to help you game smarter.

The Surprising Truth You Need to Know!", "url": "/posts/Does-Age-Really-Impact-Skill-in-Esports-The-Surprising-Truth-You-Need-to-Know/", "categories": "Esports", "tags": "esports and age, does age affect esports performance, aging and skill in esports, reflexes in esports, age limit for esports players, peak age in esports, older players in esports, mental agility in esports, esports retirement age, experience vs reflexes in esports", "date": "2024-10-18 09:00:00 -0400", "snippet": "Unlocking the Science Behind Age and Skill: How Experience and Reflexes Shape Esports PerformanceIntroduction: The Age-Old Question in EsportsIn traditional sports, athletes often peak in their late twenties or early thirties, but does the same hold true for esports? With professional gamers emerging in their teens and retiring in their mid-twenties, many wonder if age plays a critical role in esports performance. Can younger players always outshine their older counterparts due to faster reflexes, or does experience and strategy offer an edge as players age? This article delves deep into the research and player insights to answer the burning question: does age really impact skill in esports?Does Age Affect Reflexes in Esports?One of the most frequently discussed aspects of age in esports is the speed of reflexes. Reaction times are key in fast-paced games like Fortnite, Valorant, and League of Legends, where split-second decisions often determine victory or defeat.The Science of Reflexes and AgeStudies show that reaction times tend to slow as early as the mid-twenties. According to research published in PLOS ONE, cognitive-motor performance begins to decline with age, and this decline typically starts around age 24. Another study mentioned by PBS NewsHour also found that the brain’s response time begins to decline after the age of 24.In games like Counter-Strike 2 or Call of Duty, where milliseconds matter, this decrease in speed can seem like a significant disadvantage. However, esports isn’t purely about raw reflexes. In fact, many successful older players leverage their knowledge, game sense, and decision-making skills to maintain competitive performance.Experience: The Power of Game KnowledgeWhile younger players may have an edge in reaction time, older players bring a wealth of experience to the table. In esports, mastering complex strategies, understanding game mechanics, and learning from thousands of hours of gameplay often outweigh pure speed. Veterans have seen the meta evolve, learned from mistakes, and adapted to changes in gameplay that give them an advantage in certain situations.Experience Trumps Reflexes?Take Dota 2 as an example. Professional players like KuroKy (Kuro Salehi Takhasomi), who’s still competing at the highest level in his 30s, have proven that experience can offset the physical decline in reflexes. Knowledge of intricate strategies, game sense, and leadership within the team dynamic can turn an experienced player into an asset, even in an era where younger, faster players are on the rise.Mental Agility and Cognitive DeclineBeyond reaction time, mental agility is another factor that may change with age. Cognitive flexibility—the ability to adapt to new situations and switch between different mental tasks—often peaks in early adulthood. Yet, some evidence suggests that certain aspects of cognitive performance, such as complex problem-solving and pattern recognition, remain strong into the later stages of life.Mental Stamina and AdaptabilityWhile younger players may be quicker to adapt to new mechanics or updates in a game, older players often excel in consistency, focus, and emotional resilience. Mental stamina, the ability to stay focused during long sessions or tournaments, is an underrated aspect of esports performance. Younger players may experience burnout or impulsiveness, while seasoned pros maintain a level-headed approach to high-stakes situations.The Retirement Age in Esports: A Self-Fulfilling Prophecy?Many players retire from professional esports in their mid-to-late twenties, leading to the perception that aging hampers performance. But is this retirement age driven by biological factors or the structure of the esports industry itself?Industry ExpectationsEsports contracts, sponsorships, and team decisions often favor younger players, creating a cycle where older players face fewer opportunities. This doesn’t mean they’ve lost the ability to compete—rather, the industry’s focus on emerging talent and fresh faces drives early retirements. Additionally, the intense training schedules can lead to physical and mental exhaustion, encouraging players to leave the scene earlier than athletes in traditional sports.Notable Older Esports Players Who Defy AgeTo further debunk the myth that age is a barrier in esports, let’s look at some legendary players who have maintained high-level performance well into their late 20s and older. Faker (Lee Sang-hyeok) – Considered one of the best League of Legends players of all time, Faker continues to compete at the highest level in his mid-to-late twenties. His understanding of the game and his ability to evolve with the meta allow him to remain a dominant force in esports. Daigo Umehara – A Street Fighter legend, Daigo has been competing for over two decades. Even in his 40s, he continues to dominate the competitive fighting game scene, proving that experience and adaptability can outshine youthful reflexes. ZeRo (Gonzalo Barrios) – Known for his excellence in Super Smash Bros., ZeRo remained a top competitor for years due to his unrivaled game sense and decision-making skills, demonstrating that knowledge can often surpass raw reflexes. Frequently Asked Questions About Age and Esports1. At what age do esports players peak?Esports players typically peak between 16 and 22 years old in reflex-heavy games. However, strategy-based games and roles that require leadership or decision-making, such as in MOBA and RTS games, see players excelling well into their 30s.2. Why do so many esports players retire in their 20s?Early retirements are often driven by industry pressures and burnout rather than purely physical decline. Esports athletes train for long hours, leading to physical and mental exhaustion over time. Additionally, younger talent is prioritized for sponsorships and team positions.3. Can older players still compete in esports?Yes, many older players continue to compete and excel in esports. Veterans leverage their game knowledge, decision-making skills, and experience to remain relevant in the competitive scene, even as their reflexes naturally decline.Conclusion: Age vs. Skill in Esports – It’s Not Black and WhiteWhile it’s true that reflexes may slow with age, the notion that older players are at a significant disadvantage in esports is a myth. Esports, like any other competitive endeavor, requires a combination of skill, experience, and mental fortitude. Younger players may have the speed, but older players bring game knowledge, emotional stability, and tactical insights that can keep them in the game.The next time someone tells you that esports is only for the young, remember the veterans still making their mark in the industry. With the right mindset and strategy, age doesn’t have to be a limiting factor—it can be a competitive advantage.Omnic.AI is an AI-powered performance gaming tool designed to help you game smarter.

Whether you’re new to the game or looking to refine your skills, understanding the mechanics and techniques of building will give you a significant advantage in fights. This guide takes you from beginner tips to advanced strategies, ensuring you not only survive but thrive in combat scenarios.1. Purpose of Building: Beyond ProtectionWhile building provides protection and mobility, its true power lies in giving players the upper hand in fights. Building strategically allows you to control the battlefield, dictate engagements, and create opportunities to outmaneuver opponents. Instead of just shielding yourself from attacks, think of building as a tool to secure superior positioning, set up shots, and trap enemies.2. Understanding Peeker’s AdvantageOne of the essential concepts in Fortnite combat is the “Peeker’s Advantage.” This term refers to the slight delay caused by latency between players’ screens. The player who initiates an attack from a hidden position gains a split-second advantage, allowing them to fire a shot before their opponent even has the chance to react. Mastering this can make the difference in intense build fights, giving you the edge needed to secure a win.3. The Fundamentals of Boxing Up“Boxing up” is a core defensive and offensive tactic every Fortnite player must learn. This technique involves quickly constructing a protective box using walls and cones. The most efficient method is to look down, spin in a circle while placing four walls, and then jump while placing two cones on top. This rapid maneuver creates a tight structure, ensuring minimal exposure to enemies and allowing you to reset, heal, or prepare for the next move.4. Pre-Firing: The Art of PredictionPre-firing is a powerful technique that can catch your opponent off guard. This involves shooting the moment an enemy’s wall breaks, ensuring your shot lands before they can react. It’s especially effective against aggressive players who push your builds with pickaxes or weaker weapons. However, precision is critical; aligning your crosshair perfectly is vital as the window of opportunity is brief.5. Edit Peaks: Creating Winning AnglesEditing your builds to create firing angles, or “edit peaks,” is a high-level tactic to gain the upper hand. Whether it’s using a “peanut butter” edit (removing the three corner squares of a wall) or finding the best right angle that reduces your exposure while maximizing your offensive potential. However, it’s crucial to choose your edit carefully based on the opponent’s position; sometimes, a peanut butter edit may expose you to quick shots if the enemy is too close. In such scenarios, a safer approach might be to create a balcony to gain a safer shot.6. Situational Awareness: Adapting TechniquesBuilding and editing must be adapted based on the opponent’s actions. For example, if your opponent is positioned above your box, you can edit to target their feet safely. Alternatively, editing a balcony on your floor can provide a clear headshot angle. Continuous adaptation and awareness are crucial, as every opponent and fight presents unique challenges.7. Practicing and Evolving: The Key to SuccessFortnite’s dynamic environment means that strategies and play styles constantly evolve. To stay ahead, practice building and editing techniques regularly. Adapting to different in-game scenarios and refining your skills is crucial for staying competitive and countering diverse playstyles. Beyond the basics covered in this guide, advanced techniques like re-boxing, high-ground retakes, tunneling, side jumps, and piece control become vital as you face tougher opponents.ConclusionBuilding in Fortnite is about more than just creating structures; it’s about outsmarting your opponent and controlling engagements. Understanding mechanics like latency (Peeker’s Advantage) and mastering techniques like pre-firing, edit peaks, and boxing up will elevate your gameplay. Remember, it’s not just about building faster—it’s about building smarter.Stay tuned for more advanced building guides as you continue to progress from a beginner to a winner!Omnic.AI is an AI-powered performance gaming tool designed to help you game smarter.

Since its launch in 2017, the game has captivated millions with constant updates, events, and new mechanics. This year’s birthday celebration brings plenty of excitement for players across all levels. The latest V31.20 hotfix introduces not only fun birthday-themed cosmetics and events but also significant updates to Ranked Mode and the introduction of Siphon Trials—a competitive event that promises to reshape gameplay strategy.Fortnite’s 7th Birthday: Time to Celebrate!As part of Fortnite’s 7th birthday celebration, players can expect classic party vibes throughout the map, including special birthday cakes and presents scattered around the battlefield. These items provide unique in-game perks—presents often containing powerful weapons or rare items, while birthday cakes offer shield and health regeneration when consumed. Additionally, Fortnite is offering birthday-themed rewards for completing limited-time quests, with cosmetic items like back blings, sprays, and emoticons up for grabs.This annual celebration is a testament to the longevity and creativity that have kept Fortnite relevant for so long, with each birthday update reminding the player base why they love the game. Whether you’re a casual or competitive player, these updates bring a dose of fun to the battlefield.Ranked Reload: New Challenges for Competitive PlayersThe birthday celebration isn’t the only thing happening this week. Fortnite has also launched Ranked Reload, a fresh take on the game’s competitive mode. Ranked Reload introduces new progression tiers, which give players more ways to showcase their skill and dedication to improving.Just like other ranked experiences in Fortnite, Ranked Reload has eight rank tiers: Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum, Diamond, Elite, Champion, and Unreal. The first five tiers—Bronze through Diamond—are split into three sub-ranks, allowing players to climb gradually as they improve. Elite, Champion, and Unreal, however, are singular ranks, reserved for the top echelon of competitive Fortnite players.With this new ranked structure, Fortnite provides a clear and challenging path for players at every skill level. Whether you’re climbing through the early ranks or pushing for Elite and beyond, there’s always a new challenge to pursue. Players aiming for the Unreal rank, in particular, will face the most intense competition, as it represents the pinnacle of Fortnite’s ranked system.The update also tweaks how points are calculated, making eliminations and placements crucial to advancing through the tiers. This refined progression system rewards consistent gameplay, ensuring that both strategy and combat skills are equally important in ranked success.Siphon Trials: A New Era of Competitive FortniteOne of the most exciting additions in the recent update is the introduction of Siphon Trials. This event brings a unique twist to competitive Fortnite by rewarding players who engage in aggressive, high-risk gameplay. In Siphon Trials, each elimination restores both health and shields, encouraging players to fight actively instead of playing passively.What sets Siphon Trials apart is that Epic Games plans to change the siphon settings each week for six weeks, experimenting with different variations to see what works best. Here’s the current schedule for the Siphon Trials: Week 1 (Starting September 24): 40 Effective Health upon eliminations Week 2 (Starting October 1): 50 Effective Health upon eliminations Week 3 (Starting October 8): 25 Effective Health upon eliminations Week 4 (Starting October 15): 75 Health Over Time (No Shield) Week 5 (Starting October 22): 50 Health (No Shield) Week 6 (Starting October 29): 25 Health and 25 ShieldEpic Games will be closely listening to community feedback throughout these six weeks and may adjust the schedule based on what the players feel delivers the best experience.This rotating format of Siphon Trials adds a layer of unpredictability to the competitive scene. It challenges players to adapt their strategies depending on how health and shield regeneration functions each week. Whether you’re a fan of aggressive gameplay or methodical strategies, Siphon Trials offers a fresh, exciting format that demands adaptability and skill.Players who thrive during the Siphon Trials will have the chance to earn exclusive cosmetic items and in-game rewards. The event emphasizes fast-paced action while maintaining strategic depth, ensuring that eliminations aren’t the only path to victory—you’ll need careful resource management to survive the competition.Final Thoughts: Fortnite’s Bright FutureWith these updates, Fortnite continues to evolve, offering new and exciting content for players of all skill levels. Whether you’re celebrating its 7th birthday by snagging some fun cosmetic items or pushing your skills to the limit in Ranked Reload and Siphon Trials, there’s something for everyone. The game’s constant innovation proves that even after seven years, Fortnite remains at the forefront of battle royale games, keeping players coming back for more.As we look forward to the next chapter, it’s clear that Fortnite will continue to push boundaries, making every season feel fresh and exciting.

Held at the iconic Dickies Arena in Fort Worth, Texas, from September 10th to 15th, the tournament brought together the top 16 Rocket League teams from around the globe. Fans witnessed intense matches, shocking upsets, and an epic grand final, proving once again why Rocket League is a dominant force in the esports world. Here’s a comprehensive breakdown of the tournament, including the new format, standout performances, and what made RLCS 2024 one for the history books.New Format and Structure of RLCS 2024This year, the RLCS introduced a slightly tweaked format. While the Swiss Stage remained a staple, determining the top 8 teams through five best-of-five rounds, Psyonix introduced a new playoff structure called the “Hybrid Elimination Bracket.” This format gave the top four teams from the Swiss Stage a significant advantage, allowing them two opportunities to make it to the finals. Meanwhile, teams seeded 5th-8th only had a single elimination chance, adding higher stakes to every match and rewarding top performance in the earlier rounds.In contrast to previous years, where 24 teams participated, the RLCS 2024 featured a tighter roster of 16 qualified teams from various regions, including North America, Europe, South America, Middle East &amp; North Africa, Oceania, Asia-Pacific, and Sub-Saharan Africa. This more focused selection increased the intensity of the competition, as every team had to fight through regional qualifiers and major events to secure a coveted spot at Worlds.Swiss Stage Overview: The Battle BeginsThe tournament kicked off with the Swiss Stage, a highly regarded format known for its ability to thoroughly test teams’ skills. This stage saw all 16 qualified teams pitted against each other in a bid to advance to the top 8. Matchups were determined based on previous win-loss records, ensuring that each round paired teams of similar strengths.Some of the standout performances in the Swiss Stage came from North America’s G2 Stride and Europe’s Team BDS. G2 Stride, led by MVP player Beastmode, dominated their matchups and secured a high seeding heading into the playoffs. European teams such as Karmine Corp and Gentle Mates Alpine also showed strong gameplay, proving Europe’s continued presence as a powerhouse in Rocket League.Playoffs: The Road to the FinalsThe playoffs adopted the new Hybrid Elimination Bracket format, which immediately brought excitement and unpredictability to the tournament. The top four seeds had two chances to make it to the finals, while seeds 5-8 had just one shot, creating high-pressure situations.The playoff rounds were filled with breathtaking matches and numerous overtimes. G2 Stride and Team BDS continued to assert their dominance, but other teams like FURIA Esports and Team Falcons gave them a run for their money. One of the most nail-biting matchups was between Karmine Corp and G2 Stride, where G2 almost suffered a reverse sweep but managed to secure their spot in the finals.Grand Final: Team BDS vs. G2 StrideThe grand final showdown between Team BDS and G2 Stride lived up to the hype. G2 Stride kicked off the series with an explosive performance, securing a 5-0 win in Game 1. However, Team BDS quickly adapted, showcasing remarkable strategy and mechanical prowess. As the series progressed, BDS found their rhythm, winning several crucial games and sealing the tournament victory with a final 4-2 scoreline.Team BDS’s triumph in the grand finals marked their exceptional journey throughout the tournament. The team took home the championship trophy along with the grand prize of $300,000. G2 Stride, while falling short in the final match, earned a well-deserved $150,000 for their outstanding performance.Memorable Moments and Key Takeaways Beastmode and G2 Stride’s Dominance: G2 Stride, powered by star player Beastmode, made an impressive run through the tournament. Beastmode’s LAN performance and strategic gameplay were critical in taking G2 to the finals, reinforcing North America’s strong presence in Rocket League esports. The Swiss Stage Test: The Swiss Stage once again proved to be a rigorous test for the teams. This format helped identify the best performers and set the stage for a dramatic playoff run, highlighting the strength of the tournament’s structure. Minor Regions Rising: Teams from regions like the Middle East &amp; North Africa and South America showed their potential by competing head-to-head with the best in the world. FURIA Esports, from South America, managed to upset previous World Champions, Team Vitality, in the quarterfinals, signaling a promising future for minor regions. Team BDS’s Resurgence: After a disappointing performance at the London Major earlier in the year, Team BDS bounced back at the World Championship, proving their resilience and solidifying their position as one of the top teams in Rocket League. ConclusionThe RLCS 2024 World Championship was a thrilling spectacle that showcased the highest level of Rocket League competition. From the new playoff format to the unexpected upsets and legendary plays, the tournament delivered an action-packed week for fans and players alike. Team BDS’s victory not only crowned them champions but also set the stage for an exciting future in Rocket League esports.

Unpacking His Rise to the Top", "url": "/posts/Is-Peterbot-the-Fortnite-GOAT-Unpacking-His-Rise-to-the-Top/", "categories": "Valorant", "tags": "Peterbot Fortnite, Fortnite GOAT, FNCS 2024 Global Championship, Fortnite tournament results, Peterbot vs Bugha, Fortnite competitive scene, Peterbot achievements, best Fortnite players, Fortnite esports 2024, Fortnite clutches", "date": "2024-09-09 09:00:00 -0400", "snippet": "How Peterbot’s Consistent 2024 Performances Have Earned Him the Title of Fortnite’s Greatest of All Time(VIA: Epic Games)IntroductionThe Fortnite competitive scene is full of iconic players like Bugha, Clix, and Mongraal, but 2024 has ushered in a new name that is turning heads — Peterbot. This rising star, alongside his duo partner Pollo, dominated the Fortnite Champion Series (FNCS) Global Championship 2024 and other major tournaments this year , leading fans and analysts to seriously consider him as the “Greatest of All Time”.Peterbot’s year of top-tier placements, game-winning clutches, and unmatched consistency makes a strong case for him being Fortnite’s GOAT. Let’s break down Peterbot’s recent achievements, skill set, and why his 2024 season may have cemented his place as Fortnite’s greatest player.Peterbot’s Dominance in 2024: A Season to RememberPeterbot’s journey through 2024 has been nothing short of spectacular. He and his duo partner, Pollo, have consistently placed at the top of the leaderboard in nearly every event they’ve entered. The duo’s defining moment came at the FNCS 2024 Global Championship on September 8, 2024, where they not only won but did so with a dominant performance. Securing three Victory Royales on the final day, they earned a staggering $400,000 prize and a place in Fortnite history.One of the tournament’s highlights came when Peterbot clutched two solo endgames, moments that will be remembered as some of the most thrilling in competitive Fortnite. These clutches sealed their championship victory and proved Peterbot’s ability to perform under the highest pressure.But the FNCS Global Championship wasn’t the only highlight of Peterbot’s 2024 season. He has consistently placed highly in other top-tier tournaments, demonstrating unmatched consistency and dominance throughout the year: 1st Place - FNCS 2024 Global Championship (September 8, 2024): Peterbot and Pollo secured $400,000 with a dominant performance. 2nd Place - Esports World Cup 2024 (August 11, 2024): Finished 2nd place and earned $160,000. 1st Place - FNCS 2024 Major 3: North America Grand Finals (July 28, 2024): Won $140,000, marking their second FNCS win of the year. 2nd Place - DreamHack Dallas 2024 (June 2, 2024): Finished 2nd place and earned $44,000, proving consistency against top-tier players. 1st Place - FNCS 2024 Major 2: North America Grand Finals (May 19, 2024): Won $140,000, continuing their dominant run. 2nd Place - FNCS 2024 Major 1: North America Grand Finals (February 25, 2024): Kicked off the year with a 2nd place finish, earning $90,000. 1st Place - Xfinity Stable Wars #2 (February 22, 2024): Partnered with Reet to secure $20,000 in a B-tier event, showcasing his versatility. Note: The above amounts are being reported as team winnings.Skill Set: Why Peterbot is a Cut Above the RestPeterbot’s rise to prominence isn’t just about placements — it’s about how he plays the game. His unique skill set and ability to thrive in high-pressure moments make him stand out from other contenders for the Fortnite GOAT title. Endgame Mastery: In Fortnite, the endgame is often where tournaments are won or lost, and Peterbot’s ability to clutch in these critical moments is unparalleled. His performance at the FNCS Global Championship, where he secured two solo endgame victories, proves his nerves of steel and unmatched focus. Mechanical Precision: Fortnite requires impeccable mechanical skills, including fast building, editing, and aiming. Peterbot excels in all of these areas. His quick decision-making and flawless execution allow him to outplay his opponents in even the most chaotic situations, giving him the edge he needs to win. Adaptability Across Formats: Whether he’s playing in duos, solos, or squads, Peterbot has proven that he can excel in any format. This adaptability is crucial in a constantly evolving game like Fortnite, where new metas and strategies emerge with every update. Consistency: Some Fortnite pros are known for peaking at individual events, but Peterbot’s key strength lies in his consistency. His impressive run through multiple FNCS Majors, DreamHack Dallas, and the Global Championship throughout 2024 showcases his ability to maintain top-tier performance over an extended period. Comparing Peterbot to Other Fortnite Legends: Is He Really the GOAT?When discussing the GOAT of Fortnite, names like Bugha and Clix often come to mind. However, Peterbot’s incredible 2024 season puts him firmly in this conversation. Bugha: As the 2019 Fortnite World Cup Champion, Bugha is often considered one of the greatest players in Fortnite history. However, while Bugha’s World Cup win was historic, his performances in 2024 haven’t matched the consistency and dominance of Peterbot. Clix: Known for his aggressive playstyle and influential presence in the Fortnite community, Clix is a fan favorite. However, his recent tournament results pale in comparison to Peterbot’s consistent top placements in the FNCS and other major events. In 2024, Peterbot’s achievements, combined with his ability to consistently perform at the highest level, give him a legitimate claim to the Fortnite GOAT title. While Bugha and Clix have their respective legacies, Peterbot’s dominance in a highly competitive field speaks volumes about his potential to surpass these legends.Conclusion: The Case for Peterbot as Fortnite’s GOATPeterbot’s 2024 season has been nothing short of spectacular, and his string of high placements, coupled with his clutch performances under pressure, make a compelling case for him being considered the GOAT of Fortnite. As the FNCS Global Champion and one of the most consistent players of the year, Peterbot’s legacy is already being written, and it’s one of dominance, skill, and adaptability.While Fortnite’s competitive scene will continue to evolve and new stars will undoubtedly emerge, Peterbot’s incredible achievements in 2024 solidify his place as a top contender for the Fortnite GOAT title. For now, Peterbot reigns supreme, and the future looks brighter than ever for this young star.Omnic.AI is an AI-powered performance gaming tool designed to help you game smarter.

Many players are underestimating just how powerful she can be, but once you dig into her abilities and potential use cases, it becomes clear that VYSE is set to be a game-changer. Between her versatile flash, unbreakable wall, and the ability to disable enemies’ weapons, VYSE brings a unique toolkit that could make her one of the most impactful agents in the game. Let’s break down why VYSE might be even stronger than you first thought.Arc Rose (E): A Flash Like No OtherVYSE’s signature ability, Arc Rose, is an ingenious flash mechanic that sets her apart from other agents. Unlike most flashes in Valorant, which require you to put away your weapon, Arc Rose allows VYSE to keep her gun out, maintaining full combat readiness. This alone makes the ability incredibly strong for both solo plays and team setups.The flash can be placed on any surface and activated from anywhere on the map, making it a versatile tool for controlling the battlefield. The lack of an animation when activating the flash gives VYSE an advantage, allowing her to respond instantly to any threat. The Arc Rose flash is comparable to Breach’s flash in terms of windup time and duration, but with the added bonus of audio cues that indicate whether an enemy has been hit.The cooldown on this ability is surprisingly low at just 20 seconds, and VYSE can even pick it up and redeploy it during the round. This ability’s potential for information gathering and team coordination is immense, though it does have the slight drawback of being destructible if the enemy spots it early.Razorvine (C): Slowing Down the CompetitionVYSE’s Razorvine is an area denial tool that slows and damages enemies who move through it. While it might not be the most powerful ability in her kit, it’s still highly useful for controlling key areas of the map. Razorvine can be placed strategically to slow down pushes or make it difficult for enemies to rotate.This ability isn’t particularly strong in terms of damage, dealing only six damage per tick, but it excels at slowing down enemies, making it difficult for them to maneuver. Razorvine’s duration is quite long, lasting about 8 seconds with a total active time of 10 seconds including activation and fade times. While it may not be as impactful as a Sage slow or Chamber’s Trademark, Razorvine can still disrupt enemy movements and create opportunities for your team.Shear (Q): The Unbreakable WallShear is VYSE’s most disruptive ability, capable of splitting enemy teams and creating advantageous situations for her allies. When an enemy crosses the trigger line, an indestructible wall rises, separating the enemy team or cutting off access to critical areas. The wall’s uptime is around 7 seconds, a significant amount of time in the fast-paced world of Valorant.This ability shines in both offensive and defensive scenarios. On defense, it can slow down a push, giving your team time to rotate or set up. On offense, it can isolate an enemy, making it easier to pick them off or force them into unfavorable positions. The wall’s quick formation leaves little time for enemies to react, making it a reliable tool for controlling the flow of the game.Shear is also incredibly cost-effective at just 200 credits, offering immense value for the price. Its versatility opens up numerous strategic possibilities, from blocking sightlines to trapping enemies in vulnerable positions.Steel Garden (X): The Ultimate Weapon DisablerVYSE’s ultimate ability, Steel Garden, is a powerful tool that can turn the tide of a round. When activated, Steel Garden jams the primary weapons of all enemies within its radius, forcing them to rely on pistols for the duration of the effect. This ultimate is particularly devastating in eco rounds, where the enemy team might not have the firepower to deal with VYSE’s team effectively.The ultimate lasts for several seconds and affects all enemies within a large area, making it ideal for site retakes or pushing a contested area. The long wind-up time gives enemies a brief window to prepare, but once the effect kicks in, it’s incredibly disruptive.Steel Garden is especially useful in ranked play, where coordination might not be as tight. The ability to suddenly force enemies into a disadvantageous position can easily turn a losing round into a winning one.Conclusion: VYSE’s Potential is MassiveVYSE is an incredibly versatile and powerful agent who brings a fresh dynamic to Valorant’s Sentinel role. Her abilities offer a mix of crowd control, information gathering, and direct combat advantage, making her a valuable asset in any team composition. While it’s still early days and players are just beginning to explore her potential, it’s clear that VYSE is not to be underestimated. Whether you’re looking to disrupt enemy plays, gather crucial intel, or simply outgun your opponents, VYSE has the tools to make it happen.As with any new agent, it’s important to keep an eye on how the meta evolves around VYSE. However, based on her kit, it’s likely that she will become a staple in many players’ arsenals. Don’t sleep on VYSE—she might just be the key to your next victory.Omnic.AI is an AI-powered performance gaming tool designed to help you game smarter.

What was once merely a recreational activity has transformed into a multi-billion dollar industry with substantial influence in academia. Universities and colleges across the globe are investing heavily in esports facilities, recognizing the myriad benefits that competitive gaming brings to their institutions. But what’s fueling this significant investment? How are these institutions benefitting, and what does the future hold for esports in education? In this article, we’ll explore the growing trend of esports in higher education, backed by key statistics that highlight the importance of this investment.The Rise of Esports in EducationEsports has seen explosive growth, evolving from niche competitions to mainstream entertainment. According to Statista, the global esports market is projected to show an annual growth rate (CAGR 2024-2028) of 7.10%, resulting in a projected market volume of $5.7bn by 2028, reflecting its widespread appeal and lucrative potential. This growth has sparked interest from educational institutions, which see esports as a powerful tool for engaging students, enhancing campus life, and generating new revenue streams.Increased Campus InvestmentOne of the clearest indicators of the growing importance of esports in education is the significant increase in campus investments. According to a report from Facility Executive, higher education institutions increased their spending on campus facilities by over 26% in 2023. A substantial portion of this investment has been directed toward esports infrastructure. This trend highlights the recognition of esports as a key area for student engagement and recruitment. Schools are not just building arenas; they are creating comprehensive ecosystems that support both competitive and recreational gaming.Growth in Esports ProgramsThe number of universities and colleges with varsity esports programs has surged in recent years. As of 2023, over 200 institutions in North America alone have established varsity esports programs, compared to just a handful a few years ago. This rapid growth underscores the increasing importance of esports in higher education. Institutions like Maryville University, Winthrop University and the University of California, Irvine, have led the way in developing robust esports programs, complete with dedicated facilities, academic courses, and student support systems.Revenue PotentialThe financial potential of esports is another major driver behind the investments. The esports market is expected to reach a revenue of $4.3bn globally by the end of 2024, offering substantial revenue opportunities for educational institutions. By investing in esports facilities, universities can tap into new funding streams through sponsorships, partnerships, and hosting events. For example, Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) have successfully leveraged esports to attract funding and enhance their academic offerings. Johnson C. Smith University, for instance, has partnered with major gaming companies like Riot Games to develop esports programs that also serve as a revenue source for the institution.Student DemandStudent interest in esports is remarkably high, further fueling institutional investments. A study by the [National Association of Collegiate Esports (NACE)] found that over 72% of students express interest in participating in or supporting esports programs. This demand is compelling schools to invest in facilities that cater to both competitive and recreational gamers. By providing state-of-the-art esports facilities, universities not only meet this demand but also enhance student satisfaction and retention.Strategic Benefits for Educational InstitutionsThe strategic benefits of investing in esports extend beyond immediate financial returns. Esports facilities enhance campus life by providing new social spaces where students can connect, compete, and collaborate. These spaces are often equipped with the latest technology, making them attractive venues for both academic and extracurricular activities. Moreover, the integration of esports into academic curricula, such as courses in game design, digital marketing, and esports management, prepares students for careers in a rapidly growing industry.ConclusionThe investment in esports facilities by educational institutions is more than just a trend—it’s a strategic move that reflects the evolving landscape of higher education. By building state-of-the-art gaming facilities, developing academic programs related to esports, and creating new opportunities for student engagement, universities and colleges are positioning themselves as leaders in innovation. The future of esports in education is bright, with continued growth expected in the coming years. Institutions that embrace this trend are likely to see significant benefits, from increased student enrollment and retention to new revenue streams and enhanced campus life.Omnic.AI is an AI-powered performance gaming tool designed to help you game smarter.

With the evolution of video games from simple entertainment to massive virtual worlds teeming with opportunity, brands are seeing untapped potential to reach highly engaged audiences. However, the question remains: Are gamers ready to embrace more in-game ads, or is there a line that should not be crossed? This blog explores the current state of in-game advertising, its impact on the gaming experience, and whether players are truly open to this evolving trend.The Evolution of In-Game AdvertisingIn-game advertising isn’t a new concept. From the early days of product placements in racing games to the more sophisticated dynamic ads in today’s online multiplayer environments, the gaming industry has long flirted with this form of monetization. However, with the global gaming market expected to reach over $200 billion by 2024, the push for in-game advertising is stronger than ever.Initially, ads in games were simple, static banners or product placements. However, technology and creativity have transformed these into immersive experiences that blend seamlessly with gameplay. For instance, League of Legends and Rocket League have successfully integrated in-game ads through branded content and arena sponsorships, making them feel like a natural part of the game rather than a disruptive element.The Gamers’ Perspective: Acceptance or Annoyance?The critical question is: How do gamers feel about this influx of ads? The answer is complex. A survey by the Interactive Advertising Bureau (IAB) found that 61% of gamers are open to in-game advertising if it enhances or does not disrupt their gaming experience. This statistic reveals a nuanced stance—gamers are not inherently opposed to ads, but the context and execution are crucial.What Makes Ads Acceptable? Relevance: Gamers are more likely to accept ads that are relevant to their interests. For example, a gamer playing a sports simulation game might not mind seeing ads for real-world sports events or merchandise. The relevance of ads can enhance immersion rather than break it. Non-Intrusive Placement: Ads that blend into the game environment, such as billboards in racing games or banners in sports arenas, are often more acceptable because they mimic real-life settings. They don’t pull the player out of the experience. Reward-Based Advertising: Some games offer players in-game rewards for engaging with ads. Whether it’s watching a short video for extra lives or bonuses, this model tends to be well-received because it offers value to the player. The Downsides of In-Game AdsHowever, not all in-game ads are welcomed. Intrusive ads that interrupt gameplay or pop up unexpectedly can lead to frustration and pushback from the community. A prime example is mobile games, where players are often bombarded with ads that disrupt the flow of the game. This can lead to negative reviews and a drop in user engagement.Moreover, there’s a concern about the over-commercialization of gaming spaces. As games increasingly resemble digital billboards, some players fear the loss of the escapist experience that gaming offers. This sentiment is especially strong among hardcore gamers who value immersion and narrative integrity.Are Gamers Ready for More In-Game Ads?The readiness of gamers for more in-game ads hinges on the balance between monetization and user experience. The gaming community is diverse, ranging from casual mobile gamers to dedicated PC and console players, and their tolerance for ads varies widely. Casual Gamers: Casual players, especially those who play free-to-play mobile games, have a higher tolerance for ads, as they understand this is often the trade-off for accessing the game without cost. However, even within this group, the preference is for non-intrusive and reward-based ads. Hardcore Gamers: This segment is more resistant to ads, particularly those that are seen as intrusive or irrelevant. For hardcore gamers, the quality of the gaming experience is paramount, and anything that detracts from immersion can be seen as a significant downside. The Future of In-Game AdvertisingThe future of in-game advertising will likely be shaped by technological advancements and the ability of developers and advertisers to create ads that enhance rather than detract from the gaming experience. One promising area is the use of artificial intelligence and machine learning to deliver highly personalized and contextually relevant ads. Imagine playing an open-world game where the billboards change dynamically based on your location and interests, or where in-game items are subtly branded but enhance your experience.Additionally, virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) games present new frontiers for in-game advertising. As these platforms grow, they offer unique opportunities for brands to create immersive and interactive ads that are a natural fit for the gaming environment.ConclusionSo, are gamers ready for more in-game advertisements? The answer is a cautious “yes,” but with significant caveats. Gamers are open to ads that respect their experience, are contextually relevant, and provide value, whether through rewards or enhanced realism. However, the key to success lies in the careful and thoughtful integration of ads that feel like a natural extension of the gaming world, rather than a disruptive force. As the gaming industry continues to evolve, so too must the strategies for in-game advertising, always with the player’s experience at the forefront.Omnic.AI is an AI-powered performance gaming tool designed to help you game smarter.

But what sets this competition apart from others in the esports arena? Why is it considered one of the hardest esports competitions to win? In this article, we’ll explore the unique challenges, fierce competition, and the relentless pressure that make the FNCS Global Championship a daunting challenge, even for the most skilled players.The Unforgiving Structure of FNCSThe FNCS Global Championship is designed to be a gauntlet that tests every aspect of a player’s skill, endurance, and mental toughness. Here’s why its structure contributes to its reputation as the hardest esports competition to win:1. Multiple Qualification StagesQualifying for the FNCS Global Championship isn’t a single event; it’s a series of grueling stages, each more challenging than the last. Weekly Tournaments: The road begins with regional weekly tournaments where thousands of players compete for series points. Only consistent top performers advance, making it difficult to stay at the top. Elite Cups and Major Events: Players who excel in weekly tournaments move on to Elite Cups and Major events, where the competition is even more fierce, and the margin for error is razor-thin. Final Regional Championships: Even after advancing through these stages, players must still secure top positions in their region to qualify for the Global Championship. This multilayered qualification process weeds out all but the most skilled and dedicated players. 2. Adaptability to Constant Meta ChangesFortnite is known for its frequent updates, which often introduce new mechanics, weapons, and items that can drastically alter the game’s meta. Rapid Adaptation: To succeed in FNCS, players must not only master the current meta but also adapt quickly to any changes that occur during the competition. This requires an exceptional level of game knowledge and flexibility.3. Global CompetitionThe FNCS Global Championship brings together the best players from every region, each with their own playstyles and strategies. Diverse Playstyles: Competing against top players from different regions adds a layer of complexity, as players must adjust their strategies to counter unfamiliar tactics. The diversity in playstyles makes it one of the most unpredictable and challenging esports tournaments.4. High Pressure and StakesThe pressure in the FNCS Global Championship is immense, given that it is an in-person LAN event, with millions of viewers and massive prize pools at stake. Mental Toughness: The ability to perform under pressure is critical. Players must maintain focus, manage stress, and make split-second decisions in high-stakes situations. The psychological demands of the tournament can be as challenging as the gameplay itself.The Skills Required to SucceedWinning the FNCS Global Championship requires a unique blend of skills that go beyond mere mechanical prowess. Here’s what it takes:1. Exceptional Mechanical SkillsBuilding, editing, and aiming are foundational skills in Fortnite, but in FNCS, these skills must be honed to near perfection. Precision and Speed: Players must execute complex builds and edits with incredible speed and accuracy, often under intense pressure from opponents.2. Strategic ThinkingFortnite’s dynamic environment and battle royale format require strategic thinking and advanced game sense. Rotations and Positioning: Knowing when and where to rotate, managing resources, and choosing the right engagements are crucial for surviving to the late game and securing high placements.3. Consistency Across MatchesIn FNCS, it’s not enough to have one or two good games; players must be consistently excellent across multiple matches. Adaptability: The ability to adapt to different situations, whether it’s dealing with unfavorable loot or navigating the storm, is key to maintaining consistency.4. Teamwork and Communication (for Team Formats)In team-based formats, the importance of teamwork and communication cannot be overstated. Synergy and Coordination: Teams that can communicate effectively, synchronize their strategies, and support each other during matches are far more likely to succeed in the FNCS.Why FNCS Stands Out Among Esports CompetitionsCompared to other esports, FNCS presents a unique set of challenges that make it exceptionally hard to win:1. Ever-Evolving Game EnvironmentUnlike more static esports like Counter-Strike 2 or League of Legends, where maps and metas are relatively stable, Fortnite’s environment is constantly changing. This requires players to stay continuously updated and adaptable, making long-term dominance difficult.2. Battle Royale ComplexityThe battle royale format adds a layer of randomness and unpredictability that’s absent in traditional esports. Players must not only be skilled but also able to handle the chaotic nature of a shrinking play area, random loot, and multiple opponents.3. Sheer Number of CompetitorsThe FNCS Global Championship is open to millions of players worldwide, making the field incredibly competitive. The sheer number of participants and the high level of competition make advancing through the stages an extraordinary feat.ConclusionThe FNCS Global Championship is a true test of skill, strategy, and mental fortitude. Its complex structure, constant meta shifts, global competition, and high stakes combine to make it one of the hardest esports competitions to win. For those who dare to take on this challenge, the journey is as demanding as it is rewarding. Success in FNCS not only requires exceptional gaming skills but also the ability to adapt, strategize, and perform under pressure. Only the best can rise to the top, making the FNCS Global Championship a proving ground for the elite of esports.Omnic.AI is an AI-powered performance gaming tool designed to help you game smarter.

With advancements in gaming technology such as Razer’s Snap Tap mode, Wooting’s SOCD mode, and MSI’s SkySight, the debate over standardizing hardware and peripherals has intensified. This article explores the potential impact of standardization on the esports industry, addressing key questions and providing valuable insights into this critical issue.The Case for StandardizationFair CompetitionOne of the strongest arguments for standardizing hardware and gaming peripherals is the creation of a level playing field. By ensuring all competitors use the same equipment, disparities caused by superior hardware are eliminated. This fairness is crucial in professional esports, where even the slightest advantage can determine the outcome of a match.Consistency and ReliabilityStandardization ensures consistent performance across all matches and tournaments. With unified hardware, players can expect the same response times, display quality, and overall experience, which can significantly reduce the variability that might affect their performance. This consistency is not just beneficial for players but also for viewers who can expect a high-quality, uniform experience.Simplified LogisticsFor tournament organizers, standardizing equipment simplifies logistics. Managing and maintaining a single type of hardware is more efficient than accommodating various setups. This efficiency can lead to cost savings and smoother tournament operations, ensuring that events run on time and without technical hitches.The Challenges of StandardizationPersonal PreferencesEsports athletes often develop strong preferences for specific peripherals that suit their play style and comfort. Standardization might negatively impact their performance if they are forced to use unfamiliar equipment. This aspect is crucial, as player comfort and familiarity with their gear can significantly influence their in-game performance.Innovation StiflingThe rapid pace of innovation in gaming technology is driven by competition among manufacturers. Standardizing peripherals might stifle this innovation, as companies would have less incentive to develop new and better products. Esports thrive on cutting-edge technology, and limiting this innovation could slow down the progress of the industry.Sponsorship and BrandingMany esports teams and players have sponsorship deals with hardware manufacturers. Standardizing peripherals could complicate these relationships, potentially leading to conflicts and financial losses. Sponsors play a vital role in the esports ecosystem, and their support is crucial for the growth of the industry.ConclusionStandardizing hardware and gaming peripherals in esports presents both significant benefits and notable challenges. While it can ensure fair competition and consistent performance, it might also impact player preferences, stifle innovation, and complicate sponsorships. As the industry continues to evolve, finding a balance between standardization and flexibility will be key to maintaining the growth and integrity of esports.Omnic.AI is an AI-powered performance gaming tool designed to help you game smarter.

Just last week, Ibai Llanos, a popular Spanish streamer, hosted a virtual concert on Twitch that broke the platform’s all-time viewership record with an astounding 3.85 million concurrent viewers, rivaling the audience of some cable TV events. But is this a fleeting trend, or is Twitch truly the new primetime for entertainment?Arguments for Streaming as Mainstream Entertainment Massive Viewership: Twitch boasts over 140 million monthly active users and an average of 31 million daily visitors12. In 2022 alone, viewers watched over 1.3 trillion minutes of content on the platform1. Diverse Content: While gaming remains a core pillar, Twitch’s categories have expanded significantly. “Just Chatting” is now the most popular category, followed by music and creative arts. Major sports leagues like the NBA and NFL have partnered with Twitch for exclusive content3. Interactive Experience: A 2023 study by Nielsen found that Twitch viewers are 1.6 times more likely to discuss brands and products seen on the platform compared to traditional TV viewers4. This highlights the power of Twitch’s chat and community features in driving engagement. Influencer Culture: Streamers like Kai Cenat, Pokimane, and xQcOW have become household names, with millions of followers and lucrative brand deals. Some have even crossed over into mainstream media, appearing on talk shows and magazine covers3. Accessibility and Affordability: Twitch is free to watch (with optional subscriptions) and accessible on various devices, making it a low-barrier entry point for both viewers and creators2. Arguments Against Streaming as Mainstream Entertainment Niche Appeal: Despite its growth, Twitch’s audience skews younger, with 73% of users under 35. This suggests it may not yet have the broad appeal of traditional television12. Monetization Challenges: While top streamers earn substantial income, the vast majority struggle to make a living. This raises questions about the sustainability of Twitch as a career path for creators3. Content Moderation Issues: Twitch has faced criticism for its handling of hate speech, harassment, and inappropriate content. This could deter some viewers and advertisers4. Case Studies Ibai’s Concert: In a groundbreaking event, Spanish streamer Ibai Llanos hosted a virtual concert’s that drawn millions of concurrent viewers on Twitch, showcasing the platform’s potential for large-scale live events1. Just Chatting’s Rise: The “Just Chatting” category overtook gaming in 2020, showing the platform’s evolution beyond its roots. This category encompasses everything from casual conversations to live music performances2. Esports Viewership: The League of Legends World Championship regularly draws millions of viewers, rivaling traditional sports events2. ConclusionWhile Twitch’s meteoric rise and cultural impact are undeniable, its status as the “new mainstream” is still evolving. It faces challenges in monetization, content moderation, and broadening its appeal. However, its interactive nature, diverse content, and accessibility make it a compelling alternative to traditional entertainment. Whether Twitch becomes the sole king of live entertainment or coexists alongside established media remains to be seen. One thing is certain: the way we consume and interact with entertainment is changing, and Twitch is at the forefront of that transformation.Omnic.AI is an AI-powered performance gaming tool designed to help you game smarter.

This delay between pressing a button and seeing the action on screen can disrupt the gaming experience and affect performance, especially in fast-paced titles. Here at Omnic.ai, we understand the importance of responsive gameplay, and through our advanced data analytics and computer vision technologies, we continuously seek solutions that enhance gaming performance. Today, we’re discussing the top five ways you can decrease input delay for a smoother and more responsive gaming experience.1. Upgrade Your Hardware Monitor: Switch to a gaming monitor with a high refresh rate (144Hz or higher) and low response time (1ms GTG is ideal). Gaming monitors are designed to handle rapid inputs more efficiently than standard monitors, significantly reducing visual delay. Controller/Keyboard: Use high-quality, wired controllers or mechanical keyboards. Wired connections eliminate the uncertainties of wireless latency and are generally more reliable for fast responses. Graphics Card: Ensure your graphics card is robust enough to handle your game at the settings you use without bottlenecking performance. A more capable card can render frames faster, thereby reducing input lag. 2. Optimize Your Game SettingsLowering your game’s resolution and turning off high-demand graphics features such as V-Sync, motion blur, and anti-aliasing can reduce the load on your GPU, allowing it to render frames more quickly and reduce input lag.Additionally, enabling game modes specifically designed to optimize performance, often found in both game settings and on modern TVs and monitors, can also help minimize delay.3. Improve Your Connection Wired Connections: When playing online, use a wired Ethernet connection instead of Wi-Fi. A wired connection reduces the chance of interference and packet loss, which can cause noticeable delays in fast-paced games. Internet Speed: Ensure your internet connection is fast and stable. Upgrading your plan or switching to a more reliable ISP can decrease the time it takes for game data to travel to and from the server. 4. Update Your Drivers and SoftwareRegularly updating the drivers for your graphics card, monitor, and input devices ensures you benefit from the latest improvements and optimizations made by manufacturers. Similarly, keeping your game and operating system updated can help you take advantage of the latest patches that might include performance enhancements.5. Use Local Game Mode OptionsMany TVs come equipped with a ‘Game Mode’ setting that bypasses some of the usual image processing to reduce lag. This can be particularly useful if you are gaming on a console connected to a television.By implementing these strategies, gamers can expect not only to enhance their gaming experience by reducing input lag but also to improve their overall performance in competitive settings. At Omnic.ai, we’re committed to leveraging our technological expertise to help you measure and optimize these aspects, ensuring every session is as rewarding and effective as possible.

However, the recent duo format has led to a whirlwind of confusion and controversy that has both players and fans scratching their heads. Today, we’ll break down the situation, spotlighting how an obscure rule led to potential disqualifications of top-tier players, including the globally recognized Mero.The Rule That Shook the GroundAt the heart of the chaos is rule 4.1.6 of the FNCS, which stipulates that players may only compete on one team per session. If a player qualifies for the semi-finals with different teams through series points, only the team with the highest series points remains qualified. This rule, largely unknown or misunderstood by many, has thrown a wrench into the strategies of several top players.The Fallout of Team SwitchingBefore week two of the competition, several tier one teams unexpectedly split. This strategic shuffle was initially thought to void their week one placements, leaving them just one week to qualify for the FNCS semi-finals. However, the discovery of rule 4.1.6 revealed a new layer of complexity: players who split and did not outperform their week one placement with their new teammates were at risk of being forced to reunite with their previous partners—or face disqualification.Specific Cases of DisruptionTake, for example, the case of Mero and Avivv, who placed 46th in week one. Mero then teamed up with Dukez, and Avivv with Chubs. Under the newly spotlighted rule, both new duos would need to surpass the 46th place to avoid mandatory reformation with their original partners. Failure to do so not only forced them back with their previous teammates but also led to disqualifications if the original placements were not outpaced.The Impact on the Competitive LandscapeThis rule revelation has led to a significant reshuffling within the FNCS leaderboards and raised questions about the clarity and communication of competition guidelines. The scenario has resulted in numerous teams being either forced to revert to their original pairings or facing disqualification, adding an unexpected layer of drama and complexity to the tournament.Looking ForwardAs the semi-finals loom and a bye week provides a pause in the action, all eyes are on Epic Games to see how they will address this unprecedented situation. The community is split, with some finding the drama entertaining and quintessential to the competitive spirit of Fortnite, while others criticize the confusion and lack of clarity in the rules.This scenario highlights the importance of clear communication in competitive gaming and the potential impact of rules that may not be well understood by even the most seasoned players. As the FNCS progresses, it will be interesting to see how this unfolds and what changes might be made to prevent similar issues in future tournaments.For now, players and fans alike are left in a state of suspense, watching to see how one of the most bizarre chapters in FNCS history will conclude. Whether this will lead to a major overhaul of the rules or simply a lesson learned in the heat of competition remains to be seen.Omnic.AI is an AI-powered performance gaming tool designed to help you game smarter.

At Omnic.AI, we’re dedicated to helping you level up your gameplay through in-depth analysis and actionable insights. Today, we’re tackling an often overlooked yet critical aspect of gaming: effective VOD (Video on Demand) review. Whether you’re aiming to climb the competitive ladder or simply enhance your skills, understanding how to analyze your gameplay can lead to significant improvements.Beyond Just WatchingMany players, especially at lower levels, are told to “just watch your games back and learn from mistakes.” However, merely watching your replays is not enough. Players often fall into the trap of associating every good outcome with a good decision and every bad outcome with a poor decision, which isn’t always accurate.Understanding the Four Outcomes of Gameplay DecisionsEffective VOD reviewing requires categorizing your gameplay decisions into four possible outcomes: Positive (Good Outcome + Good Decision): These moments are where strategy and outcome align perfectly. While they are moments to replicate, it’s crucial to understand what exactly made them successful. Negative (Bad Outcome + Bad Decision): These instances are straightforward and crucial for learning, as they clearly show where improvements are needed. False Positive (Good Outcome + Bad Decision): These deceptive moments may lead you to repeat risky tactics because they worked once by chance, potentially setting you up for future failures. False Negative (Bad Outcome + Good Decision): These situations are challenging but important. They involve sound decisions that didn’t pan out due to unpredictable elements, teaching you to trust your strategic instincts despite unfavorable outcomes. The Importance of FundamentalsMastering VOD review and making smarter in-game decisions hinge on your understanding of Fortnite’s fundamental aspects: Building: Develop quick and effective building techniques for cover, offense, and movement, like erecting walls for protection, ramps for elevation, and stairs for flanking. Combat: Hone your aim across different weapons and ranges. Understand each weapon’s strengths and weaknesses to select the best tool for each battle and master build battles to outmaneuver opponents. Game Sense: Enhance your map awareness to keep track of the storm circle and enemy locations. Learn effective rotation strategies to maintain advantageous positions and predict enemy movements to stay ahead. Inventory Management: Optimize your inventory by prioritizing the right weapons and healing items. Ensure quick access to essentials during combat and adapt your loadout based on available loot and game dynamics. Decision Making: Cultivate the ability to make swift, strategic decisions under pressure. Decide when to engage, when to heal, and when to build, adapting your strategy to each unique situation while maintaining composure. Leveraging Insights from Your ReplaysAt Omnic.AI, our tools use computer vision technology to analyze your recorded gameplay, providing detailed statistics and coaching insights. These tools are designed to help you identify the types of decisions you’re making and understand their outcomes, enabling you to recognize patterns that require adjustment.By adopting a nuanced approach to VOD reviewing and focusing on fundamental gameplay skills, you can make more informed, effective decisions that not only enhance your individual performance but also positively impact your team dynamics.Happy gaming, and remember: every replay is an opportunity to learn and improve!Omnic.AI is an AI-powered performance gaming tool designed to help you game smarter.

However, the gaming community is currently facing a significant challenge: the prevalence of cheating. This issue not only undermines fair play but also diminishes the overall gaming experience for honest players. With the traditional methods lagging in efficiency and effectiveness, it’s time to look towards innovative solutions. Enter computer vision, a promising ally in the battle against in-game cheating.The Current State of Cheating in Competitive FPS GamesThe surge in cheating incidents has been a growing concern for both players and developers. Despite the efforts to curb this menace, the existing frameworks struggle to keep pace with the sophisticated methods employed by cheaters. The problem is twofold: the sheer volume of cheating reports and the complexity of the cheats themselves. Traditional detection methods, which often involve code analysis and gameplay review, are proving inadequate in identifying and addressing these advanced cheats.Introducing Computer Vision: A Game-ChangerComputer vision, a field of artificial intelligence, empowers computers to interpret and understand the visual world. By analyzing video footage, this technology can detect anomalies and patterns indicative of cheating behavior. Here’s how computer vision could revolutionize the fight against cheating in video games:Pre-Screening of Gameplay VideosWhen a player reports an incident of cheating, developers are typically required to review the gameplay footage manually – a time-consuming task. Computer vision can streamline this process by pre-screening the videos, highlighting potential instances of cheating. This not only accelerates the review process but also allows developers to focus on the most suspicious cases, improving response times and the overall efficiency of the detection system.Detecting the UndetectableMany cheats in today’s competitive FPS games are designed to be stealthy, making them extremely difficult to detect through code analysis alone. These include aimbots, wallhacks, and other subtle yet game-altering modifications. Computer vision, with its capability to analyze visual cues and patterns, can identify these cheats by observing inconsistencies in gameplay that are characteristic of such unfair advantages.Adapting and EvolvingOne of the most compelling aspects of computer vision is its ability to learn and adapt. Through machine learning algorithms, this technology can continuously evolve, enhancing its ability to detect new and evolving forms of cheating. This adaptability ensures that the detection mechanisms remain a step ahead of cheaters, maintaining the integrity and competitiveness of the gaming environment.The Road AheadWhile the potential of computer vision in combating video game cheating is immense, its implementation is not without challenges. It requires robust infrastructure, substantial processing power, and ongoing refinement of the underlying algorithms. Moreover, the balance between effective cheat detection and respecting player privacy is crucial.Nevertheless, the integration of computer vision into cheat detection systems represents a significant leap forward in ensuring fair play and a positive gaming experience. As this technology matures, it could very well become the standard in the industry, safeguarding the spirit of competition and the joy of gaming.As we navigate the evolving landscape of competitive gaming, embracing innovative solutions like computer vision is not just an option—it’s an imperative. By leveraging this technology, developers can enhance their arsenal against cheaters, ensuring that the virtual battlegrounds of FPS games remain a fair and thrilling arena for all players.Omnic.AI is an AI-powered performance gaming tool designed to help you game smarter.

Fortnite Chapter 5 Season 2, “Myths &amp; Mortals,” was supposed to launch today, but eager warriors are facing an extended wait. Epic Games encountered unexpected issues during maintenance, pushing the downtime for update v29.00 further than anticipated.According to a statement from the official Fortnite Status Twitter account @FortniteStatus, the initial downtime was expected to last “a few hours longer than usual.” That wait time has been extended to a whopping eight extra hours. So, instead of jumping into the new season this morning, players will have to wait until at least 5pm ET to clash on the slopes of Mount Olympus or explore the underworld.This unexpected delay is certainly frustrating, especially considering the hype surrounding the Greek mythology theme. Dataminers have revealed glimpses of the new map locations, battle pass skins, and powerful Mythic weapons, but players are still locked out of experiencing them firsthand.While the wait is a bummer, here’s a silver lining: you can still download the update while the servers are offline. That way, you’ll be ready to dive into the action as soon as the gates of Olympus open at 5pm ET. Until then check out the top 5 changes coming this season!Top 5 Changes Dropping in Fortnite Chapter 5 Season 2Fortnite Chapter 5 Season 2, titled “Myths &amp; Mortals,” has ALMOST arrived, and it’s bringing a legendary storm of new content. Buckle up, warriors, because this season is all about battling it out under the watchful gaze of the Greek gods! Here’s a glimpse at the top 5 changes that’ll have you rewriting your Fortnite battle plan:Gods of the Grind: A Mythic MakeoverThis season’s theme isn’t just cosmetic. The map itself has been reshaped to reflect iconic locations from Greek mythology. Prepare to clash on the slopes of Mount Olympus, guarded by a towering statue of Zeus. For the brave souls who dare, the Underworld awaits, patrolled by the fearsome Cerberus. Scattered throughout these legendary landscapes are Mythic weapons wielded by the gods themselves. Hurl lightning bolts with the Thunderbolt of Zeus or unleash a hail of fire with the Gatekeeper Shotgun, a triple-barreled beast.Armory of the Ancients: New Weapons and Weapon ModsThe Mythic loot isn’t the only firepower upgrade. “Myths &amp; Mortals” introduces a fresh arsenal of conventional weapons. Take down foes from afar with the Huntress DMR, a long-range rifle perfect for sniping. For close-quarters chaos, the Warforges AR delivers high damage and rapid fire, but be prepared for some serious recoil! New weapon mods also join the fray. The Thermal Scope grants unparalleled vision and heat detection, while the Speedgrip lets you move faster while aiming down sights.Clash of the Titans: Battle Pass PantheonThe Chapter 5 Season 2 Battle Pass is your ticket to godhood (well, almost). Tier up to unlock legendary outfits inspired by Greek myths. Dominate the battlefield as Zeus, the king of the gods, or channel the power of the underworld with Hades. Fan favorites from other franchises also make an appearance, including Korra from the Legend of Korra series.Glory Awaits: Competitive TournamentsWhether you’re a seasoned competitor or an aspiring champion, “Myths &amp; Mortals” offers a chance to test your mettle in a variety of tournaments. The Women of the Arena returns, giving female players a platform to showcase their skills. New PlayStation Cups, Console Cash Cups, and Ranked Cups are also on the calendar, so there’s a competition for every level.Starter Packs for the DivineNew players can jump into the fray with themed starter packs. The Battle Royale starter pack includes a new skin, pickaxe, and back bling, while the Save the World starter pack offers the Vinderman 2.0 set. And for those who love building with bricks (both digital and real), the LEGO Fortnite starter pack grants a Brite Agent skin, back bling, and a digital Brite Bomber Bedroom building set.Omnic.AI is an AI-powered performance gaming tool designed to help you game smarter.

Just like a perfectly seasoned dish, a balanced game offers a fair and engaging experience for all players, regardless of skill level or chosen strategy. But achieving this balance, especially in games with intricate mechanics and ever-evolving metas, can be a daunting task for developers. This is where machine learning (ML) steps in, offering a fascinating potential to revolutionize how we approach game balance for the future.Machine Learning: A Versatile PowerhouseMachine learning, a branch of artificial intelligence, empowers computers to learn and improve without explicit programming. From optimizing search engines to revolutionizing healthcare, its applications are vast and growing. In gaming, ML has already found its way into areas like enemy behavior and AI-powered opponents. Now, it’s poised to make a significant impact on the crucial aspect of game balance.Machine Learning Techniques for Game Balance:Supervised Learning: This method involves training ML models on labeled data, where the desired outcome is already known. In game balance, this could involve training models to identify imbalanced win rates or underutilized strategies by analyzing labeled data of player performance and win/loss outcomes.Unsupervised Learning: This technique allows the model to discover patterns and relationships within unlabeled data. For game balance, this could involve identifying player behavior clusters or unexpected correlations between character choices and in-game actions, potentially revealing unforeseen imbalances.Reinforcement Learning: This approach involves training an AI agent through trial and error, allowing it to “learn” by interacting with the game environment and receiving rewards for desirable behaviors. In the context of game balance, this could be used to create AI opponents that autonomously adapt their strategies based on player performance, helping developers assess the effectiveness of balance changes without needing extensive human testing.Understanding the Crucial Balance ActGame balance refers to the careful design and adjustment of in-game elements, ensuring that no singular strategy, character, or weapon dominates the experience. This is critical for fostering a healthy esports ecosystem where players compete on a level playing field and strategic diversity flourishes. However, achieving and maintaining balance is an ongoing challenge for developers. Analyzing vast amounts of player data, identifying subtle imbalances, and implementing effective adjustments can be a time-consuming and resource-intensive process.Analyzing the Game’s DNAThis is where ML comes into play. By analyzing massive datasets of player performance, character selection, win rates, and in-game behavior, ML algorithms can identify subtle imbalances that might escape human observation. These insights can include:Characters with consistently high win rates.Strategies or weapons that consistently outperform others.Game mechanics that are underutilized or overpowered.When ML Scores a WinSeveral games have already begun leveraging ML for balance adjustments. In League of Legends, ML algorithms analyze millions of games to identify champion imbalances, leading to data-driven balance updates. Similarly, Dota 2 implements “Matchmaking Rating” and “Hero Recommendations” using ML, ensuring players are matched with similar skill levels and suggesting heroes based on player preferences and win rates.Benefits for All: A Win-Win ScenarioThe integration of ML offers numerous benefits for both developers and players:For Developers:Faster and more efficient balance adjustmentsData-driven decision-making, leading to more informed changesEnhanced player satisfaction with a fairer and more engaging gameFor Players:Fairer gameplay with a level playing field for allMore diverse strategic options, fostering creativity and innovationImproved game longevity with a continuously balanced and engaging experienceChallenges and Considerations: Navigating the Ethical LandscapeWhile ML holds immense potential, it’s not without its challenges. Interpreting complex ML data can be cumbersome, and overfitting, where models overemphasize specific data points, can lead to inaccurate conclusions. Moreover, ensuring that ML-driven changes align with the game’s core vision and don’t homogenize the gameplay experience is crucial. Additionally, ethical considerations like data privacy and potential bias in algorithms need to be addressed responsibly.A Machine-Learning Powered LandscapeAs technology evolves, we can expect even more sophisticated ML techniques to emerge, further refining game balance. New AI methodologies like reinforcement learning might enable games to dynamically adjust themselves based on player behavior, creating a truly adaptive and challenging experience.Machine learning presents a powerful tool for developers to ensure a more balanced and engaging future for esports. While challenges persist, the potential benefits for both developers and players are undeniable. As we move forward, embracing the responsible application of ML opens doors for innovative and exciting possibilities in the realm of game design and competitive gaming.Omnic.AI is an AI-powered performance gaming tool designed to help you game smarter.

This branch of advanced analytics, powered by artificial intelligence (AI), has the power to predict, at least theoretically, almost anything, including how games are played and won. This post delves into how predictive models already have improved to the point that they can anticipate opponent behavior and analyze historical data, player tendencies, and map dynamics to predict enemy rotations, site pushes, and eco rounds.Predictive Models in EsportsPredictive models in esports use machine learning algorithms to analyze vast amounts of data from past games. These models can predict outcomes based on player performance, draft selection, and features from the game itself, including character information and real-time game process statistics. For instance, a study on Dota 2 outcomes prediction compared Linear Regression, Neural Networks, and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models. As it turns out, neural networks seem to be the most promising when it comes to predicting DOTA 2 match outcomes.There have already been successful real world applications of predictive analytics in esports. For example, a machine learning approach was used to outsmart the esports market, achieving a return rate of around 14% for Dota and around 98% for CS:GO.Anticipating Enemy RotationsOne key aspect to game sense is the ability to correctly anticipate enemy rotations. This means there is vast untapped potential in utilizing AI to do exactly that. There is plenty of data available – Omnic Forge’s AI systems already analyze player movements and strategies. All it takes is to push a little bit further and utilize predictive models to forecast where the enemy team might move next. This ability to predict common types of enemy movement while, importantly, maintaining coordination with your own team would give your team a huge competitive advantage.Predicting Teamfight OutcomesIn games like Overwatch 2, and League of Legends, winning teamfights is essential to winning matches. Given enough data, predictive models may begin to understand the nuts and bolts of what goes into winning a teamfight. Right now, it is up to coaches to ensure each member of the team is doing what is most optimal – using their abilities at the exact right time in the exact right way. With the assistance of predictive AI, imagine the new heights professionals and amateurs alike will be able to achieve.Forecasting Eco RoundsIn games like Valorant and CS:GO, managing the in-game economy is a critical aspect of strategy. In fact, Omnic.AI has already done a study with grad student Sophia Cofone on the importance of economy when determining match outcomes. These findings, when combined with more advanced predictive modeling, very well could lead to an ultra-efficient level of Valorant economy management the likes of which we have not seen in any esport.ConclusionPredictive analytics has already begun revolutionizing esports, providing teams with unprecedented insights and a competitive edge. As AI continues to evolve, we can expect its impact on esports to grow, making the games we love even more exciting and strategic.Omnic.AI is an AI-powered performance gaming tool designed to help you game smarter.

Despite the introduction of new teams and the VCT CN league, the season’s format, particularly the scant number of regular season games, raises concerns.The Kickoff Tournament - Just a Tease?The season starts with a Kickoff Tournament in February, a stage meant to build momentum. But with only two teams per league advancing to Masters Madrid, it feels more like an appetizer than a full course. This format, while engaging, is just a fleeting glimpse of what could be a far more robust competitive experience.The Puzzling Game Count:Here’s the rub: each team is slated to play a mere 10 regular season matches. In a world where esports fans are accustomed to lengthy, immersive seasons, this number is underwhelming. For a title as dynamic as VALORANT, limiting the regular season to just 10 matches is a missed opportunity for deeper team development and fan engagement.Championship Points - A Band-Aid Solution?The new Championship Points system, designed to reward consistent performance, feels like a consolation for the limited number of matches. Winning key events and regular matches contributes to a team’s points tally, but does it compensate for the lack of regular season gameplay?A Critical Perspective on Riot’s Strategy:Riot Games’ decision to restrict the regular season to 10 matches per team is puzzling. This approach seems to prioritize brief, high-stakes tournaments over a sustained competitive narrative that could unfold over a longer season. It’s a strategy that risks alienating a fanbase eager for more content and fails to leverage the growing global interest in VALORANT.The Call for More:The esports community has seen the benefits of longer seasons in other titles. More matches mean more opportunities for teams to showcase their skill, adapt to the meta, and engage in strategic depth. It also means more content for fans and a more vibrant, active esports ecosystem.Conclusion:As we stand on the cusp of VCT 2024, it’s clear that Riot Games needs to reconsider its approach. VALORANT, a game celebrated for its depth and dynamism, deserves a competitive scene that mirrors these qualities. It’s time for Riot to expand the number of regular season matches, embracing the potential of VALORANT Esports and truly catering to the community’s appetite for more action.Omnic.AI is an AI-powered performance gaming tool designed to help you game smarter.

However, this addition has sparked a debate in the gaming community, with many arguing that the Outlaw is “broken” and drastically alters the game’s dynamics. Let’s delve into why this new weapon is causing such a stir.Unprecedented Fire Rate and Scope MechanicsThe Outlaw stands out with its ability to fire two powerful shots rapidly without breaking the zoom on its scope. This feature significantly enhances a player’s ability to engage multiple targets quickly or deliver a follow-up shot without repositioning or losing sight. In a game where precision and quick reflexes are key, the Outlaw provides an advantage that can be seen as overwhelming, especially in the hands of skilled players.Balancing Power and PricePriced at 2,400 credits, the Outlaw bridges the gap between the Marshal and the Operator, both in terms of cost and firepower. While this makes the weapon more accessible in various economic situations in the game, it also introduces a powerful tool that can be exploited in rounds where traditionally, teams might not have access to such high firepower. This can lead to shifts in how rounds and economy management are approached.Impact on Game MetaEvery new addition to a game’s arsenal inevitably affects its meta, and the Outlaw is no exception. It offers a new playstyle that can be particularly potent against specific strategies prevalent in the current meta. Its high damage output and unique firing mechanism can break the traditional sniper duels and long-range engagements, leading to a need for new strategies and counterplays.Potential Overpowering in Skilled HandsIn the hands of a highly skilled player, the Outlaw can be a game-dominating weapon. Its high damage and unique firing mechanism, combined with the ability to maintain zoom, can lead to dominating performances that may not leave much room for counterplay, especially in lower to mid-tier levels of play where players may not have developed effective counter-strategies.Community Feedback and Future AdjustmentsAs with any major change in a competitive game, community feedback plays a crucial role. The introduction of the Outlaw has been met with mixed reactions, with some players enjoying the new dynamics it brings, while others feel it disrupts the balance. Riot Games, known for its attention to community feedback, may need to monitor the Outlaw’s impact closely and make adjustments to maintain the competitive integrity of Valorant.In conclusion, while the Outlaw adds exciting new gameplay options to Valorant, its potential to disrupt the game’s balance cannot be overlooked. It will be interesting to see how the game’s meta evolves around this new addition and what steps Riot will take in response to the community’s feedback. As always, the goal is to maintain a balanced, competitive, and enjoyable gaming experience for all players.Omnic.AI is an AI-powered performance gaming tool designed to help you game smarter.

Platforms like Twitch and YouTube could employ AI to create personalized viewing experiences, suggesting content based on viewing habits. AI-driven tools might also generate instant highlights and in-depth game analyses, enhancing the viewer’s understanding and enjoyment.Automated Refereeing and Fair PlayAI’s role in ensuring fair play will expand significantly.

Wearables and biometric sensors could feed data into AI systems, like those developed by companies such as WHOOP, to track players’ physical and mental stress levels, ensuring they stay at their optimal performance state.Personalized AI-driven TrainingAI-powered training programs will offer a more personalized approach. Technologies similar to AIMLABS, which provides tailored training to improve aiming skills in FPS games, could be developed for a wider range of skills and strategies across various esports titles.Game Balancing and Design InsightsAI will play a crucial role in game development and balancing. By analyzing player feedback and performance data, AI can provide insights to developers for balancing gameplay.

On one front, we have the “Esports Winter” with consolidation, restructuring and the re-evaluation of VC funding into the sector. On the other front, viewership, gaming industry revenue and users from emerging platforms (like mobile and web3) are growing exponentially. With that, excitement and support on the grassroots level has never been stronger and it’s our belief that over the next five years, there will be a significant rise in the popularity of video game coaching for various reasons. Let’s dig in on why.Closing of Generational GapsAs the gaming industry has matured, so has the acceptance and understanding of video games as a legitimate form of entertainment and competition. One of the significant catalysts for the rise of video game coaching is the closing of generational gaps. Traditionally, older generations viewed gaming as a mere pastime, often dismissing it as a frivolous activity with little value. However, as the younger generations, who grew up with video games enter adulthood, there is a massive shift in perception.Parents who were once skeptical of the benefits of gaming are now recognizing its potential for skill development, teamwork, and strategic thinking. This changing mindset has paved the way for a more supportive environment where video game coaching is seen as a positive and constructive influence. Video game coaching will eventually be seen as another after-school activity alongside more traditional enrichment programs like soccer practice, guitar lessons, swimming and gymnastics.As generational gaps continue to close, the demand for coaches who can guide and mentor aspiring gamers will inevitably rise.The Rise of Scholastic SupportAnother key driver behind the anticipated surge in video game coaching is the increasing integration of gaming into educational institutions. Esports has gained significant traction in schools and universities, offering students opportunities to showcase their skills in a competitive setting. In recent years, scholastic esports has been edging closer to the path of traditional sports with scholarship offerings, varsity teams and integration into athletic conferences like the Mid-American Conference (MAC) with their launch of the ESC. As gaming becomes more ingrained in scholastic environments, the need for qualified coaches becomes apparent.Scholastic support for gaming is not limited to collegiate esports programs; it extends to high schools and even middle schools. Schools recognize the value of teaching students essential life skills such as teamwork, leadership, communication, and strategic thinking through video games. Video game coaching is seen as a means to enhance these skills, providing students with valuable insights and guidance to excel in both their gaming pursuits and academic endeavors.The integration of video game coaching into scholastic environments also addresses concerns about the potential negative impacts of excessive gaming. Coaches play a crucial role in promoting responsible gaming habits, emphasizing the importance of balance between screen time and other aspects of life. This holistic approach ensures that gaming is not only a source of entertainment but also a tool for personal and academic growth.The Growth of Quality OfferingsEsports coaching is not a new concept as early-adopters in this space such as Metafy, AimLabs, and Gwoop have firmly established themselves over the last 3 years with an estimated 40M+ users combined. In addition, content creators such as SypherPK and JGOD have made a name for themselves by focusing on the instructional aspects of popular video game titles such as Fortnite and Call of Duty and garnering millions of hours in video views.A more recent and exciting trend is the rise of in-person opportunities from a variety of new and existing businesses. Six Flags and Coca-Cola premiered their seasonal installations of gaming stations within their theme parks across the US this year. A quick google search of “YMCA Esports” will show esports programs at their facilities across every city. Contender Esports is a chain of gaming centers across the US that have been offering access to high-end gaming equipment since 2018 . The Hudson Valley NY location of Contender Esports has been especially active with esports themed summer camps, after school programs and working with local schools to organize STEM and gaming themed field trips.Lastly, we here at Omnic.AI have been leveraging the power of AI and built a platform for gamers that provides personalized coaching insights to help gamers improve their skills and is accessible 24/7 from anywhere in the world.ConclusionThe next five years hold tremendous promise for the video game coaching industry. With generational gaps closing, scholastic support on the rise, and the growth of quality in-person offerings, the demand for qualified coaching is set to soar. Video game coaching is not just about improving gameplay; it’s about fostering personal growth, promoting responsible gaming habits, and guiding others on their journey to success.As the gaming community continues to evolve, so does the recognition of the positive impact that coaching can have on players of all levels. Whether it’s a student honing their skills in a scholastic esports program or a professional player striving for excellence on the global stage, the role of the video game coach is becoming increasingly vital. The next five years will likely see this trend solidify, establishing video game coaching as an integral and respected component of the gaming ecosystem.Omnic.AI is an AI-powered performance gaming tool designed to help you game smarter.

This update introduces ESRB-like age ratings for islands and cosmetic items, aiming to provide a safer and more informed gaming experience. However, the decision has been met with backlash from the community, particularly concerning the limitations imposed on previously purchased skins​​.The Scope of Age RestrictionsThe update extends to a wide range of cosmetic items. Notable skins affected by the restrictions include Agent Peely, Lara Croft, Doctor Doom, Black Widow, Cable, Leon Kennedy from Resident Evil, and Deadpool. These restrictions also apply retrospectively, meaning skins purchased in the past may now be unusable in certain game modes​​​​.Community Backlash: Rising DiscontentPlayers have expressed their dissatisfaction through social media, using the hashtag “RevertTheUpdate.” The frustration stems from the inability to use cosmetics, which were paid for with real money, in all game modes. This sentiment is particularly strong among younger players who form a substantial part of Fortnite’s user base​​.Epic’s Response and Future AdjustmentsIn response to the backlash, Epic Games has stated that only about 7% of outfits are currently affected by the restrictions. The company plans to make most of these outfits adaptable to all ratings by 2024, hoping to alleviate some of the concerns raised by players​​.Impact on Gameplay ExperienceWhile popular modes like Battle Royale and Zero Build are rated T for Teen and thus unaffected by the cosmetic restrictions, the limitations have still dampened the enthusiasm of many players. The inability to use certain skins in user-generated content has been a source of disappointment​​.The Larger ContextThis update comes amidst a period of significant change for Fortnite, with the game recently undergoing a resurgence in popularity due to the return of the OG map and other updates. However, the introduction of age-gated cosmetic restrictions has put a damper on the game’s momentum​​.Conclusion: A Balance Between Safety and AutonomyThe introduction of age restrictions in Fortnite represents a challenging balancing act for Epic Games. On one hand, it’s a step towards ensuring a safer gaming environment, especially for younger players. On the other, it raises questions about the autonomy of players and the value of their in-game purchases. This situation highlights the complexities involved in moderating content in online gaming communities.Your ThoughtsAs this debate continues to evolve, we would love to hear your thoughts. Do you believe Epic Games’ decision to impose age restrictions on Fortnite skins is a necessary step for player safety, or does it go too far in limiting player choice and autonomy?

While change can be daunting, this pivot could very well be a blessing in disguise for the Overwatch community. Let’s delve into why this evolution in Overwatch’s competitive scene might be exactly what the community needs.Opening New Horizons:The OWL, while ambitious and groundbreaking, had its limitations. Its rigid structure, mirroring traditional sports leagues, may not have been the perfect fit for the dynamic world of esports. This transition opens the door to new, potentially more inclusive and dynamic formats that can invigorate the community.Collaboration with Esports Veterans:Blizzard’s potential collaboration with established third-party organizers like ESL FACEIT Group and WDG esports is promising. These organizations have a proven track record in successfully managing esports events. Their expertise could bring fresh perspectives and innovative approaches to Overwatch tournaments.Grassroots and Community Engagement:One of the most exciting prospects of this change is the potential boost to grassroots movements within the Overwatch community. A more decentralized approach to tournaments could empower local communities, allowing for more grassroots-level events and giving rise to new talents.Flexibility and Diversity in Competition:A new competitive ecosystem may introduce more flexibility in how tournaments are structured. This can lead to a diverse range of events, catering to different segments of the Overwatch community – from casual players to hardcore enthusiasts.Enhanced Global Reach:OWL’s city-based team model, while unique, did have geographical limitations. The transition could lead to a more globally inclusive approach, bringing in players and fans from regions that were previously underrepresented.Renewed Focus on Game Development:This shift might enable Blizzard to align the competitive scene more closely with Overwatch’s ongoing development, especially with Overwatch 2 in the mix. A competitive scene that evolves in tandem with the game can lead to a healthier, more sustainable esports ecosystem.Player and Team Dynamics:The changes could result in a more dynamic and diverse landscape for players and teams. New formats might encourage a wider range of strategies and play styles, making the competitive scene more exciting and unpredictable.Reinvigorating Fan Interest:Change can rekindle interest. For long-time fans and players, this transition might reignite the passion for Overwatch esports. For new fans, the revamped structure could be less daunting and more engaging to dive into.Potential for Greater Innovations:With a new structure comes the opportunity for innovation not just in tournament formats, but also in broadcasting, content creation, and fan engagement. This could lead to a more vibrant and interactive experience for the community.A Community-Driven Future:Ultimately, this transition opens up opportunities for the community to have a more significant say in the direction of Overwatch esports. Community feedback and involvement could play a more central role in shaping the future of competitive Overwatch.While the transition from the Overwatch League signifies the end of an era, it also marks the beginning of a new, potentially more exciting chapter in Overwatch esports. Embracing this change can lead to a more diverse, inclusive, and vibrant community, ensuring that Overwatch remains a beloved and thrilling esport for years to come.What do you think about the future of Overwatch esports?

While Riot’s Anti-Cheat successfully detected foul play in this instance, the revelation raised broader questions. How many more such incidents go unnoticed? Could the integration of more advanced AI technologies, like computer vision and analytical analysis, provide a stronger safeguard against cheating?Real-time Computer Vision MonitoringComputer vision is a subset of AI, enabling machines to interpret and act upon visual data. In the esports context, computer vision can be employed to monitor gameplay in real-time, looking for discrepancies or abnormal patterns that might indicate foul play.Imagine an AI system that continually scans player screens, comparing in-game actions with standard gameplay patterns. Such a system could detect anomalies, like inhuman reaction times or accuracy, flagging them for review. This kind of real-time monitoring can act as a deterrent and provide an added layer of assurance to both players and fans.Advanced Analytical Analysis of Game DataBy combining detailed gameplay data with advanced analytical algorithms, AI can provide insights beyond human capabilities. Analyzing player behavior, movement patterns, and decision-making processes can help identify outliers that may not be evident at first glance.For instance, a player might consistently have knowledge of enemy positions without any in-game cues, pointing towards possible wall-hacking. A sophisticated AI would be able to detect these subtle patterns and raise alarms before they affect the outcome of a game.Player Profiling with Machine LearningMachine learning models can be trained to understand a player’s unique style, including their habits, strategies, and reaction times. By continuously updating this profile with new gameplay data, the system can alert officials if a player suddenly deviates significantly from their typical behavior.In the case of Noot Noot’s player, malibu, a detailed profile might have provided early indications of irregular gameplay patterns, potentially even before the Riot Anti-Cheat detected the cheat.Transparent and Immediate FeedbackWith the power of AI, feedback about suspicious activities can be immediate. This rapid response can reduce long intermissions, like the two-hour pause during the Noot Noot and Complexity GX3 match. Prompt feedback can help maintain the flow of the game, ensuring a better experience for both players and spectators.ConclusionWhile no system can be entirely foolproof, the integration of AI, through computer vision and advanced analytics, promises to elevate the standards of fair play in esports. Beyond just detection, these tools can act as deterrents, signaling to potential cheaters that their chances of going undetected are minuscule. As esports continues its meteoric rise in global popularity, leveraging technology to maintain the integrity of the game will be paramount.Omnic.AI is an AI-powered performance gaming tool designed to help you game smarter.

AI has proven to be a game-changer, enhancing the gaming experience in multiple ways. From content creation to esports coaching, meta discovery to customer retention, AI is revolutionizing the landscape of gaming. Dive into this exploration of the top five groundbreaking shifts that AI is introducing to gaming.Content Creation: Immersive Worlds Like Never BeforeGone are the days when building detailed game worlds and storylines took months. AI has expedited this process, ushering in a new era of content creation. Procedural generation algorithms, powered by AI, now craft expansive game universes and auto-generate quests, as witnessed in No Man’s Sky. Such advancements don’t just trim development hours but constantly offer players novel content.Beyond world-building, AI helps develop realistic character interactions. With dynamic reactions to player moves, characters appear more lifelike, paving the way for an increasingly immersive experience. As these AI tools progress, the horizon looks promising for even more captivating virtual realities.Broadcast &amp; Analysis: Enhancing the Spectator ExperienceAI is also transforming the way we watch and analyze gaming. Esports, in particular, has seen a surge in popularity, and AI is at the forefront of this transformation. AI-driven broadcast and analysis tools are making esports more engaging for both players and spectators.AI algorithms can provide real-time data analytics, such as player performance metrics and team strategies. This data is then used to create captivating visualizations and insights for viewers. AI Tools like augmented reality (AR) overlays can show player stats and live predictions, adding a new layer of excitement to the viewing experience.Moreover, AI-driven cameras can automatically follow the most action-packed moments of a game, ensuring that spectators never miss a crucial play. This level of automation and precision enhances the spectator experience, making esports more accessible and enjoyable for a wider audience.Esports Coaching: Elevating Players to the Next LevelEsports coaching has become an integral part of competitive gaming. However, finding the right coach or analyst can be a daunting task. AI is stepping in to fill this gap, providing players with personalized coaching and analysis.AI-driven coaching platforms can analyze players’ gameplay, identifying strengths and weaknesses, and offering tailored advice for improvement. These platforms use machine learning algorithms to compare a player’s performance to that of professional gamers, highlighting areas that need refinement.Scouting opponents and studying their strategies is also crucial in esports. AI can assist in this regard by analyzing vast amounts of gameplay data to provide insights into opponents’ playstyles and tendencies. This enables teams to prepare better and strategize effectively against their rivals.Watching tape, as they say in sports, has never been more advanced than in the world of esports. AI ensures that players and teams have the best tools at their disposal to elevate their game and stay competitive.Meta Discovery and Hero Composition: Mastering the Game’s BalanceIn games like Dota 2 and League of Legends, the concept of the “meta” is crucial. It refers to the most effective strategies, character combinations, and item builds at any given time. Staying ahead of the meta is essential for success, and AI is helping players and developers do just that.AI algorithms can analyze extensive datasets of in-game statistics and player behaviors to identify emerging trends and optimal strategies. For instance, AI can determine which heroes or characters are currently the most powerful and provide recommendations to players and teams. This information helps players make informed decisions about hero selection and item builds, ultimately leading to more balanced and exciting gameplay.Game developers are also leveraging AI to balance their games more effectively. By monitoring gameplay data and feedback from players, AI can suggest balance changes, helping developers create a more enjoyable and fair gaming experience. This iterative process ensures that games remain engaging and competitive over time.Customer Retention: Keeping Players EngagedAI’s impact on gaming extends beyond the gameplay itself; it’s also reshaping how gaming companies engage with their players. Customer retention is a critical aspect of the gaming industry, and AI is playing a pivotal role in keeping players engaged and satisfied.AI-powered recommendation systems analyze players’ preferences and behaviors to suggest games, in-game items, and content that align with their interests. This personalization creates a more enjoyable gaming experience and encourages players to spend more time and money within the gaming ecosystem.Moreover, AI-driven chatbots and virtual assistants are improving customer support by providing instant responses to player inquiries and issues. This not only enhances the overall player experience but also reduces the burden on customer support teams.In-game AI can also adapt gameplay difficulty based on a player’s skill level, ensuring that players are continually challenged without becoming frustrated. This dynamic adjustment keeps players engaged and motivated to continue playing.ConclusionThe integration of artificial intelligence into the gaming industry is causing a seismic shift, touching every aspect of the gaming experience. AI is driving innovation and improvement in ways we could only dream of a few years ago. As AI technology continues to advance, we can expect even more transformative changes that will shape the future of gaming.

Riot Games just dropped a patch so big, it’s like they shook the game upside down and all your favorite agents fell out of their tier lists. Say hello to new maps Sunset and the revamped Breeze, and bid adieu to Fracture and Pearl. The agent landscape has changed more dramatically than my mood when I run out of snacks. But fear not, we’ve got the 411 on who’s hot and who’s not.The Tier-ific SystemBefore we dive in, let’s get the tier lingo straight: S-Tier: The best of the best, some might say “Flawless.” A-Tier: The reliable friend who helps you move. Solid. B-Tier: The wildcard. Good in a pinch but not always the star. C-Tier: The guy who brings a kazoo to a gunfight. Bless their heart.Duelists - The “Explosion Connoisseurs” 🧨Raze is now the Beyoncé of duelists. With Jett nerfed harder than a 90s boy band’s fashion sense, Raze’s high-octane, Michael Bay-approved kit makes her the queen of the Sunset close-quarters dance floor. Neon is your A-tier speedster, thriving in Sunset’s frenetic pace and Breeze’s spacious catwalks. Phoenix is your Dueling 101 professor; he’s well-rounded and a great intro to the role. Meanwhile, Jett has been downgraded to the “still figuring it out” tier, and Yoru and Reyna are like those indie bands you claim to love but never actually listen to—niche and situational.Initiators - The “Choose Your Own Adventure” Squad 🚀There’s no LeBron James of initiators right now. Sova got nerfed just enough to join the A-tier commoners. KAY/O, Breach, and Gekko are like the three musketeers of initiating—each with their own flair but no clear standout. Skye got nerfed so hard she’s basically a Pokémon that forgot how to use its special moves. And Fade? She’s the enigma, nerfed but perhaps not out. Keep an eye on her; she might just be the dark horse.Controllers - Welcome to the “Toxic Zone” ☠️Viper is the queen bee of controllers. She’s been ruling Breeze like it’s her personal kingdom and is likely to do the same on Sunset. Astra is still, well, Astra. Omen is still your go-to smoke machine, while Brimstone and Harbor are the B-tier buddies who are good but not “invite to the VIP section” good.Sentinels - The “Big Brother is Watching” Crew 🎥Cypher is the top sentinel, basically the Gandalf of Breeze and Sunset, yelling, “You shall not pass!” Killjoy and Sage are still solid picks, like the sidekicks in every superhero movie. Chamber is making a comeback, like flared jeans in 2021. And then there’s Deadlock, who’s basically the guy still using a flip phone in 2023—outdated and outclassed.Your Two Cents 💬Agree? Disagree?

The recent unveiling of Patch 7.04 has certainly made waves in the community. While some players have embraced these updates, others, including professionals, have expressed reservations. FNATIC’s Derke, in particular, has shared some candid thoughts on the patch. Let’s delve into the updates in detail and explore the professional perspective.Patch 7.04 Highlights:Emphasis on Game State Clarity: The primary goal of this patch is to enhance gameplay clarity, especially during intense moments. This is achieved by: Reducing the frequency of large area of effect ultimates. Decreasing the duration of utility active time. Reducing the HP of shootable utility.Detailed Agent Changes: BREACH: Aftershock ticks reduced from 3 to 2 with damage increased from 60 to 80. Rolling Thunder ultimate points increased from 8 to 9. BRIMSTONE: Orbital Strike ultimate points increased from 7 to 8. FADE: Time to re-equip gun increased after using Prowler. GEKKO: Mosh Pit now does 10 damage per second before exploding. Wingman’s HP reduced from 100 to 80. Thrash explosion visuals improved for clarity. KILLJOY: Lockdown ultimate points increased from 8 to 9. OMEN: No movement velocity when casting Paranoia. SKYE: Guiding Light’s max duration while casting reduced from 2.5s to 2s. Trailblazer’s HP reduced from 100 to 80. Seekers’ ultimate points increased from 7 to 8, with health decreased from 150 to 120. SOVA: Recon Bolt’s total number of scans reduced from 3 to 2. VIPER: Viper’s Pit ultimate points increased from 8 to 9. ASTRA: Gravity Well’s startup time increased from 0.6s to 1.25s, with gravity time duration decreased from 2.75s to 2.0s. Nova Pulse’s startup time decreased from 1.25s to 1.0s. Cosmic Divide now completely blocks audio. JETT: Tailwind’s dash window decreased from 12s to 7.5s with activation windup increased from 0.75s to 1s. Cloudburst’s duration decreased from 4.5s to 2.5s. Updraft charges decreased from 2 to 1. Blade Storm’s ultimate points increased from 7 to 8.Derke’s Take on Patch 7.04:FNATIC’s Derke has been vocal about his concerns regarding the new patch: Drastic Changes: Derke humorously compares the agent balancing team to the VCT scheduling team, suggesting that both might be making too many changes simultaneously. Incremental Changes vs. Overhauls: He advocates for smaller, more incremental changes, fearing that massive adjustments might risk sidelining certain agents. Variety in Gameplay: Derke emphasizes the importance of variety in agent selection for gameplay. He feels the current changes might limit this diversity. Overlooking Agents: He points out that some agents, like Phoenix, seem to have been overlooked in the recent balance changes.Conclusion:Patch 7.04 is a testament to Riot’s commitment to refining VALORANT. While the intentions behind the patch are clear, its execution has garnered mixed reactions, especially from the pro community. As the patch rolls out and players adapt, it will be intriguing to see how these changes influence gameplay dynamics and strategies. The VALORANT community, as always, will be on its toes, ready to navigate this ever-evolving landscape.At Omnic, we are driven by the mission to empower our players, helping them level up their video game skills by providing them with the precise information they need.

Players often ponder this question, trying to figure out the best strategies and tactics to secure a win. Sophia Cofone, a Data Science Graduate Student at the Roux Institute at Northeastern University, decided to tackle this question using the power of statistics. In her research project, “Gameplay-Based Classification of Valorant Players: Insights and Feature Importance,” Cofone analyzed nearly 30,000 rounds of Valorant gameplay across all skill levels to identify the key factors that predict whether a round is won or lost. The results are intriguing and may surprise you. Let’s dive in!It’s How You Play, Not Who You PlayContrary to popular belief, agent selection isn’t the most crucial factor in determining whether you’ll win or lose a round. While team composition is important and playing an agent you’re comfortable with can be beneficial, there’s no “one-size-fits-all” agent or team composition that guarantees victory. Instead, it’s more about how you play the game.Survival is KeyWhen attacking, staying alive is the most critical factor for success, even more so than getting eliminations. Cofone’s research found that the damage taken before planting the spike significantly influenced the success of attackers. The healthier you are when planting the spike and the longer you can stay alive in the post-plant phase, the better your chances of winning the round. This finding suggests that attackers should prioritize survival over chasing down remaining eliminations, especially after planting the spike.A Strong Economy Leads to VictoryFor defenders, the key factors for winning a round include having a high-value loadout, using abilities frequently, and maintaining good health. The more utility defenders have at their disposal, the better they can delay attackers. Additionally, having better weapons allows defenders to spam smokes or common areas more effectively, slowing down enemy advances. This research implies that defenders should manage their economy wisely, ensuring they always have credits available and making full use of their abilities.Roles Are More Than Just Character ChoicesCofone’s research also led to the development of a model that could accurately predict a player’s role based on their gameplay, with an impressive accuracy rate of over 80%. This model disregarded team composition data and character choice, focusing solely on gameplay data. The results suggest that players in a specific role tend to use abilities in a similar manner across different characters within that role. While this may not seem groundbreaking, it highlights the potential for further analysis of gameplay data to uncover insights into how roles are played.A Collaborative EffortIt’s important to note that this research was conducted in partnership with Omnic Data, a leading data analytics firm in the esports industry. The collaboration between Cofone and Omnic Data showcases the potential of combining academic research with industry expertise to uncover valuable insights in the world of esports.Looking AheadCofone plans to continue refining this project and delving deeper into the data. One area of interest is identifying the critical “events” within a round that lead to a win or loss based solely on data. This could provide valuable insights for players looking to improve their gameplay.The full project is available for those interested in exploring the data and findings in more detail: https://github.com/sophiacofone/valorant_omnic. It’s an impressive accomplishment that showcases the potential of data analysis in Valorant and esports as a whole. As the esports industry continues to grow, data-driven insights like these will become increasingly valuable for players, teams, and fans alike.At Omnic, we are driven by the mission to empower our players, helping them level up their video game skills by providing them with the precise information they need.

Rising to infamy with antics ranging from Demon1’s audacious teabagging and post match comments to Head Coach Potter’s contentious remarks on EMEA’s talent pool, they’ve emerged as the veritable villains of the esports realm. The rise of this ‘bad boy’ image brings forth an intriguing question – is there a place for villains in esports? Absolutely, and here’s why:1. Villains Fuel Drama and IntriguePreviously seen as an accomplished yet somewhat ‘vanilla’ team, EG’s recent metamorphosis into the black sheep of Valorant has set the esports world abuzz. Their controversial acts have ramped up tensions with teams like Fnatic, making their confrontations all the more riveting. This newly minted narrative boosts viewership as fans eagerly pick sides, either rallying behind EG or fervently hoping for their downfall.2. Villains Forge Iconic RivalriesThere’s nothing quite like the electric atmosphere of a match where two rivals lock horns. With the inherent flux within esports often dispersing long-standing rivalries, villains step in to bridge that gap. They instigate fresh feuds and enmities, amplifying the stakes and driving viewer engagement to new heights.3. Villains Elevate the Stature of HeroesEvery compelling tale requires a formidable antagonist; someone the protagonist must overcome. Without a significant challenge, a champion’s triumph can feel hollow. Villains ensure the journey of the heroes, in this case teams opposing EG, is laden with trials. As Fnatic dons the mantle of the ‘saviors’, the stage is primed for a clash of titanic proportions.4. Villainy with BoundariesWhile villains are essential to amp up the drama and stakes, it’s crucial to strike a balance. Esports can undoubtedly benefit from a bit of theatricality and audaciousness. However, mutual respect and sportsmanship should always underpin these confrontations. A dash of trash talk, combined with genuine respect for peers and the spirit of the game, ensures a thrilling yet respectful environment for fans and players alike.In essence, villains aren’t just desirable in esports; they’re necessary. They infuse the landscape with dynamism, passion, and a narrative depth, ensuring every match is more than just a game—it’s a story.At Omnic, we are driven by the mission to empower our players, helping them level up their video game skills by providing them with the precise information they need.

The top 16 teams from across the globe are ready to lay it all on the line to earn the prestigious title of 2023 champions. With groups already announced and games slated to begin on August 6th, we’re here to provide an in-depth look at what to expect.Group AArguably one of the most competitive groups, Group A showcases a mix of regional powerhouses. On August 9th, Krü Esports from the Americas will go head-to-head with Pacific representatives Paper Rex (PRX), while EMEA’s Giants will take on Edward Gaming (EDG) from China. Despite PRX entering as favorites, all teams in the group have showcased formidable performances throughout the season. Keep an eye out for Krü and Giants, who are entering with strong momentum from their recent LCQ runs, while EDG seeks to replicate their impressive performance in Tokyo. This group is set to be a thrilling watch, with every match potentially going down to the wire.Group BGroup B is a melting pot of underdogs and surprise elements. Kicking off on August 7th, the Pacific’s T1 will lock horns with FUT Esports from EMEA, while China’s FunPlus Phoenix (FPX) will face off against Evil Geniuses (EG) from the Americas. Despite EG being the pre-tournament favorite to top the group after their stellar second-place finish in Tokyo, T1 and FUT’s promising performances cannot be undermined. Moreover, FPX could pull off some major upsets against their group counterparts.Group CGroup C is the stuff of legends. In what promises to be a clash of the titans, Bilibili Gaming from China will contend with NRG from the Americas on August 8th. Simultaneously, Pacific’s Zeta Division and EMEA’s Fnatic will vie for the upper hand in their encounter. The reigning champions, Fnatic, start as favorites, with NRG also expected to advance past the group stages. Nevertheless, don’t write off Bilibili and Zeta just yet. This group may serve up some of the most intense Valorant gameplay we’ve seen yet.Group DTagged as the group of chance, Group D is a wild card where any team could emerge victorious. In the inaugural match on August 6th, EMEA’s NAVI and Team Liquid will battle for supremacy, while LOUD from the Americas squares off against DRX from the Pacific. None of these teams had outstanding performances in Tokyo, which makes predicting a clear winner a challenging task. While LOUD and NAVI may have a slight edge, the open nature of this group could see any of the teams stepping up and taking control.The Long RoadWhile making it out of the group stage is a significant achievement, it’s just the first step on the long road towards the championship title. For now, all eyes are on these group stage battles, which promise to deliver thrilling matches filled with high-level strategic plays and intense clutch moments.Tune in starting next Sunday, August 6th, at 3 pm EST for an unforgettable display of Valorant esports at its finest.At Omnic, we are driven by the mission to empower our players, helping them level up their video game skills by providing them with the precise information they need.

The likes of AI models like ChatGPT are not just tools, but are companions in our digital journey, offering relevant information through engaging and dynamic dialogues. In the immediate future, we envision AI becoming an invisible yet indispensable ally in diverse professions, from programmers debugging codes with ease to doctors pinpointing diagnoses with enhanced precision.Mid-range AI RevolutionOn a broader horizon, AI’s prowess is set to infiltrate areas requiring automation of monotonous tasks currently shouldered by humans.

Self-navigating cars, comprehensive automation of jobs, and the integration of AI into education for personalized learning experiences are no longer distant dreams but tangible objectives. The zenith of AI’s promise rests on the concept of general intelligence AI - a creation mimicking the versatility and adaptability of the human brain, capable of multi-tasking rather than being confined to a single specific task.AI: A Construct, Not ConjureAI, however, is not an abstract, ethereal force. It is a manifestation of human ingenuity, reflecting the virtues and vices of its creators. Just as the internet can become a breeding ground for misinformation, AI too has its potential for misuse.

From a new agent to a new game mode to a new progression system, we have you covered with all the new stuff so you can jump right into the action!Deadlock - The Lockdown SentinelAgent #22 is a Sentinel focused on locking down opponents’ movements. Deadlock’s signature ability is her Gravnet which will restrict any opponents it hits, forcing them to move slowly and crouch until they remove the net applied to them. Her Sonic Sensor watches an area and will concuss opponents that make noise (by walking or shooting) nearby. The Barrier Mesh blocks movement by allies and opponents and can only be removed by shooting the center “blob.” Lastly, her ultimate will capture the first opponent hit, trapping them in a cocoon. Other opponents can break the cocoon, but if it is pulled to the original location it will eliminate the trapped opponent.Early impressions compare her to Cypher in her gameplay style, although she has more stopping power in holding an area. While she is unlikely to upset the meta, she could find some clever uses here and there.We have included a summary of Deadlock’s abilities and ultimate below:AbilitiesGravNet EQUIP a GravNet grenade. FIRE to throw. ALT FIRE to lob the grenade underhand. The GravNet detonates upon landing, forcing any enemies caught within to crouch and move slowly. Uses 1, Creds 200, Windup 0.4s, Duration 6s, Debuff Forced crouch, 85% slow beyond AoE Sonic Sensor EQUIP a Sonic Sensor. FIRE to deploy. The sensor monitors an area for enemies making sound. It concusses that area if footsteps, weapons fire, or significant noise are detected. Uses 2, Creds 200, Health 20 HP, Debuff 3.5s Concuss Barrier Mesh EQUIP a Barrier Mesh disc. FIRE to throw forward. Upon landing, the disc generates barriers from the origin point that block character movement. Uses 1, Free, Windup 3s for fortification, Duration 30s, Health 320/680 HP, 570/1200 HP when fortified (Outer orbs/Central orb) UltimateAnnihilation EQUIP a Nanowire Accelerator. FIRE to unleash a pulse of nanowires that captures the first enemy contacted. The cocooned enemy is pulled along a nanowire path and will die if they reach the end, unless they are freed. The nanowire cocoon is destructible. 7 Points, Windup 1.1s, Duration 10s, Health 600 HP, Debuff 7s Cocoon Team Deathmatch - Warm Up TogetherThe new act also brought a new game mode. Team Deathmatch pits two teams against each other in the race to 100 eliminations. Teams play through 4 rounds with stronger weapons each round. Abilities are on cooldowns and ultimates build slowly over time. Luckily, there are weapon pickups and ultimate charges that spawn on the map to speed up the process.It’s a great game mode to warm up in or play with friends, so try it out the next time you log on.Kingdom Come - Kingdom CreditsThe new act also introduced a new form of currency. Kingdom credits are earned from playing the game and can be used to unlock agents and cosmetics from previous battle passes. You can get a boost from completing daily challenges that reward credits for every tier.The system should help make progress faster for new players as well as give veteran players the chance to catch up on any cosmetics they missed.That’s the new act in a nutshell.

Fnatic from EMEA, Paper Rex from Pacific, and Evil Geniuses from Americas will battle it out and the last one standing tomorrow will be crowned winner. Don’t know who to root for? Don’t stress, as we’ll recap the top three teams right now.The Orange Juggernaut - FNATICFnatic has been on fire this tournament, only dropping a single map on their way to the grand finals. The team looks to become the first back-to-back Master’s champions, having won Lock-in earlier this year. Any of their players could be considered the best in their role and this tournament has been the chance to show that. From IGLing masterclasses from Boaster to Derke securing insane eliminations to the clutch factor of Leo, any member of the team can carry. It is like fighting a boss battle against five raid bosses; you can take down one, but the others are still there.Why Root For Them: If you like crazy good players trying to make history and think orange and black are a sick color scheme, this is the team for you.The Fearless Warriors - PAPER REXImagine a team full of crazy aim players that can and will outduel any opponent. That is Paper Rex. After finishing first in the Pacific split (and beating Pacific rival DRX in the first round of Master’s playoffs), they were bumped to the lower bracket by Fnatic and have been on a tear since. Clawing through EDG and NRG, they are in the lower bracket finals and hoping for a rematch with Fnatic. Their playstyle is exciting to watch as it uses aggression to put their opponents on their heels.Why Root For Them: If you want to see the first Pacific international championship and love seeing Duelists picked, this is the team for you.The Megamind Underdogs - EVIL GENIUSESEG is a surprise. After starting off the Americas split slow and barely making it into playoffs, the team has shocked the world with victory after victory. While the team doesn’t have the biggest names on its roster, their gameplans (cooked up by head coach Potter), teamwork, and skill have shown that big names aren’t important. Add in explosive Jett player Demon1 and the team chewed through Loud and Team Liquid without dropping a map before losing 2 - 1 to Fnatic, falling to the lower bracket finals. Kind of like Batman, with enough prep, EG can topple any team.Why Root For Them: If you love an underdog story and live life on the evil side, this is the team for you.When to WatchThe lower bracket final between EG and Paper Rex will kick off tonight at 11 pm EST. The winner then goes on to face Fnatic on Saturday at 11 pm EST. Both matches are best of fives and should be bangers.Who do you think will win Master’s Tokyo?

Tickets are sold, merchandise is worn, chants are in the air, and the parking lot is full. After every big play, the crowd roars. Historic division rivals compete with each other like they have for years upon years, locked in an eternal battle for supremacy over each other. Imagine a world where the biggest events on university campuses are not football games, but a League of Legends tournament. The truth is, such a future is not as far out as one may think.The rise of collegiate esports can be partially attributed to the rise of esports as a whole. The rise of Twitch streaming and huge esports leagues throwing around millions of dollars firmly implanted esports into the mainstream in the 2010s. The timing could not have been better – esports growth was significantly accelerated by the global year of isolation caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Headlines were made in 2021 when the Olympic Council of Asia announced esports competitions would take place in the Asian Games of 2022. As it stands now, the current market size of esports globally is estimated to be between $1.45-$1.72 billion, and is projected to be three times that size by 2030.Perhaps one of the more interesting phenomena we see in the world of professional esports is that of age. While there is much debate about why esports professionals are so young, the fact is that many of them are college-aged or even younger. It seems to be somewhat generational – GenZers grew up with ubiquitous gaming-grade hardware and AAA game titles everywhere they looked. Gaming is often seen not just as a competitive space, but as a space for socializing and entertainment. The debate between competitive and casual gaming is as old as the gaming industry itself, but in the case of collegiate gaming, there is room for both. Many schools have grassroots-level gaming and esports clubs run by and for students. These can take the shape of competitive teams or simple get-togethers where gamers can enjoy each others’ company.It is no surprise, then, that as competitive gamers begin to take their gaming habits along with them to university, the universities themselves have taken notice. Not only is there a lot of student interest, but from the university’s perspective, there is a much lower cost of entry than there is for a traditional sport such as football or basketball. All you need to set up an esports arena is a few gaming PCs, a room, and an internet connection. Colleges have begun to institutionalize esports at a rapid rate, with over 175 schools offering varsity esports (many of them with scholarships) according to the National Association of Collegiate Esports.For many top players, joining a collegiate esports team can be much less risky than trying to play for a professional team. Not only is it easier to play for a collegiate team, but you are far less likely to fall victim to a predatory contract. Furthermore, in the ultra-competitive esports scene that currently exists, players may find it much simpler to just play it safe and go to school instead of shooting for the stars. If this trend continues, though, there won’t be much of a difference. Maybe soon the highest paid public employee in every US state will be a college esports coach. Maybe soon every young gamer will be able to look at collegiate players as someone to look up to, so that one day, they too can have a crowd chanting their name when they nail headshot after headshot after headshot.If you want to step your game up to the next level sign up for the Omnic Forge and gain access to your very own AI esports coach today!" }, { "title": "Speed Over Clarity: The Primacy of Refresh Rate in Esports", "url": "/posts/Speed-Over-Clarity-The-Primacy-of-Refresh-Rate-in-Esports/", "categories": "Guide, Esports", "tags": "Esports, Competitive Gaming, Refresh Rate, Frames Per Second (FPS), Gaming Hardware, Gaming Monitors, Resolution in Gaming, Gaming Latency, High Refresh Rate Monitors, Gaming Performance", "date": "2023-06-09 09:00:00 -0400", "snippet": "Why Refresh Rate and FPS Matter More Than ResolutionIn the long and storied history of gaming, there have been countless technological advancements that change the game. In the world of competitive gaming, these advancements are critical to gaining an edge over players’ opponents. While factors such as skill, strategy, and teamwork are crucial, having a top-notch hardware experience has become essential to esports professionals. One debate that has garnered attention is the importance of refresh rate versus resolution in competitive gaming. In this blog post, we will delve into the reasons why refresh rate matters more than resolution in the realm of esports.Understanding Refresh RateRefresh rate refers to the frequency at which a display updates the images on the screen per second and is measured in Hertz (Hz). This is similar to a more familiar concept to many gamers, which is frames-per-second (FPS). It doesn’t matter how many FPS your PC can output if you’re limited to a display with a mere 60 Hz refresh rate. Effectively, in such a scenario, this is the same as artificially capping your framerate to 60 FPS. A higher refresh rate means more frequent updates, resulting in smoother and more fluid visuals, assuming your FPS is high enough to match. Traditionally, monitors with a refresh rate of 60 Hz were considered standard. However, as GPUs and CPUs have gotten more powerful and output higher and higher framerates, refresh rates of 144 Hz, 240 Hz, and even 360 Hz have become standard for esports professionals.The Impact of Refresh Rate on Competitive GamingSmooth Motion Clarity: In fast-paced games, smooth motion clarity is essential to track objects accurately and make precise movements. A higher refresh rate ensures that each frame is displayed for a shorter duration, reducing motion blur and providing a clearer image during quick actions and rapid camera movements. This enables players to maintain better visual focus and make more precise shots or maneuvers.Reduced Latency: In competitive gaming, where split-second reactions can determine victory or defeat, minimizing latency is crucial. Latency refers to the delay between an action performed by a player and its reflection on the screen. A higher refresh rate significantly reduces latency, providing players with a more immediate visual feedback. This leads to a more responsive gaming experience, as the actions performed by the player are reflected on the screen almost instantly. This instantaneous feedback enhances the overall gameplay experience and allows players to feel more connected to their in-game avatars, almost as an extension of their own body and mind. (As a side note, this feeling of bodily extension is what Virtual Reality games hope to capture). It’s no wonder that the faster you are allowed to react to something, the better of a competitive advantage you get.Competitive Advantage in Target Acquisition: Studies have shown that higher refresh rates positively impact target acquisition tasks in esports. In experiments comparing different refresh rates, it was found that performance improved monotonically with refresh rate, indicating that higher refresh rates lead to better accuracy and efficiency in clicking on moving targets.The Impact of Resolution on Competitive GamingThere is an argument to be made for the importance of resolution, as opposed to refresh rate, as the more impactful technology for esports. There are clear benefits to be gained from higher resolutions – they provide clearer visibility of in-game elements, enhancing gamers’ ability to spot enemies, read text, and distinguish small details. Improved visual clarity can significantly impact gameplay, especially in games that rely on precise aiming or require quick identification of objects or players in the environment.Across the gaming world, higher resolution monitors such as 1440p and 4k are on the rise. The world of esports is a different story, though. Time and time again, we see the most cutthroat, ultra-competitive gamers choosing to prefer the most frames possible instead of higher resolution. It is true that most esports gamers prefer at least 1080p as a baseline resolution, but any higher than that is seen as a waste of valuable GPU power that could go to higher framerates. In fact, having a higher FPS rate than your monitor’s refresh rate is actually better in many cases than capping your FPS at your monitor’s refresh rate. CS:GO players are infamous for their preference of a 4:3 aspect ratio and decreased resolution. This is because of the way the game handles player models, but still, it is an example of how resolution matters little to esports pros when there is a competitive advantage to be gained.In the competitive world of esports, where every millisecond counts, refresh rate holds more significance than resolution. While it is important to have some semblance of visual clarity through a decent resolution, outplaying your opponents rests more on being able to react quickly than being able to see the enemy clearly.Discover your potential in Valorant and Fortnite with Omnic Forge, where you’ll meet your AI esports coach to guide you to mastery.

Gather ‘round as we welcome the newest member of our Omnic Data family, Jon Miller, a certified Overwatch aficionado. Far from your everyday player, Jon brings a unique blend of humor, insight, and expertise to our team—and now, to this blog. We’re about to journey with him from his early days playing Overwatch, to his pre-tournament rituals (apparently, a healthy dose of sleep and breakfast goes a long way), and even his hilarious take on why Winston might not make the best roommate. We’ve also got a peek into what it’s like to float as Zenyatta for a day. Whether you’re a die-hard gamer or a casual player, or just someone who loves a good story, there’s a bit of everything in this conversation. So pull up a chair, pour yourself a Dr Pepper, and join us for this heartwarming initiation of our very own Jon Miller into the Omnic Data family.What initially attracted you to Overwatch as your game of choice?Honestly, it was one of the few FPS games my parents would let me play since it’s so cartoonish. That turned out to be a good thing for my framerate. I’m a big believer that refresh rate matters.How do you prepare for a big tournament? Are there any rituals or routines you adhere to?One thing gamers don’t like to admit matters a lot is taking care of your body. I’m not the best example of this, but when there’s a big tournament coming up, I try to at least get enough sleep and have a good breakfast/eating schedule for those days. The next step for me is to do a quick warmup deathmatch with my teammates before going into a warm-up scrim against another team. Ideally, those scrims are against easier teams looking for more scrim experience against better teams. That way you can win somewhat easily to build confidence and shake off any rust, and they get more experience against higher-level opponents. And of course, I keep a Dr Pepper on my desk at all times on match day.In your opinion, what are the key characteristics or skills that set a professional Overwatch player apart from an amateur?Usually when people ask how to improve in Overwatch, the answer is to simply play the game more. But I don’t think that’s enough – you have to be playing proactively and with goals in mind. If you play to just improve generally, without anything specific to be thinking about while you play, you won’t get very far. Pro players do this very well – they only take one or two reps to learn from their mistakes. They have a very high game sense because they’re able to go through the full process of identifying mistakes, figuring out the solution, and carrying it out. Mastering that process is a skill in and of itself.Which Overwatch character would make the worst roommate and why?As much as everyone loves Winston Overwatch, you have to admit he’d be tough to deal with as a roommate. Sure, he would mean well, but he is a gorilla at the end of the day. I mean, the thought of it raises a lot of questions. How would he even enter the room? Maybe I’d at least get a big house out of the deal to accommodate his size. I really don’t want to know what the bathroom situation would be like. He also has some strange peanut butter related habits.What advice would you give to someone who aspires to become a professional Overwatch player?The most important thing is to play in an organized team setting if you’re not already. When it comes to grinding it out, quantity is not always better than quality. For instance, playing 10 hours of ranked is only half as good as playing 2 hours of ranked and 2 hours of scrims. Natter has a great video on how to actually use your time efficiently as a Tier 3 Overwatch player, but the same can apply to anyone who currently plays on a team and wants to rank up. This becomes even more important when you have lots of outside responsibilities like school or work.Could you describe a specific match or play that you’re particularly proud of?Before I decided to focus on school, I wanted to put everything I had into one final tournament: The Toronto Defiant Holiday Bash (2021). My team at the time, Shikigami, was playing above our normal level and things went really well. Eventually, we played against a pickup team called “Controversial Players Academy”, where Krawi (who is now an Overwatch League tank player for the LA Valiant) was playing off-tank. As a fellow off-tank player, I can tell you there is no better feeling than outplaying the enemy off-tank’s ultimate, whether that’s eating their Graviton Surge as D.va or hooking the enemy Roadhog into your team. So, I made it my goal to cancel Krawi’s ult one way or another. Eventually I succeeded in a Sigma vs Sigma matchup on Nepal: Sanctum, where I rocked him out of his Gravitic Flux from across the map. In the end, we lost the match, but we made it a lot closer than we were expected to.If you could swap lives with an Overwatch character for a day, who would it be and why?Zenyatta is really living the best life. Not only is he an Omnic robot, but he’s a monk. I think that would be such an enlightening experience. I’m also very curious what it’s like to be able to float over 20 metal orbs around at high speeds.How important is communication during a game, and how do you ensure your team communicates effectively?I’m going to give a counterintuitive answer here and say communication is not as important as you might think. I remember a drill we ran when I was on Shikigami where we muted our mics for a map in a scrim. We actually dominated harder during that map than the other ones – I think because we were all hyper aware of what each other was trying to do, based solely on actions in-game. Overwatch is a unique game in the sense that being perceptive of your teammates’ needs is equally important, if not more so, than doing your own job. The risk with this drill is that there are many micro-level things that could fall through the cracks. For example, if I want to drop my shield as Reinhardt in order to preserve its health for longer, that’s vital information for my Baptiste to know when he’s trying to use my shield to 1v1 a Widowmaker. But even then, in this no-mic drill, the key would be to simply keep my shield up even if it means it will break. You just have to have trust in what your teammates are doing in addition to being aware of what they want to do. You might think this synergy only comes from practicing with the same people a lot, but the higher you go in the ranks, the more synergetic a team of random players will be. This indicates there is a “right way” to play the game that you eventually grasp intuitively and through a lot of practice.How do you stay updated and adapt to the constant changes and updates in Overwatch?At its core, Overwatch does not change much. The most important concepts on both the macro/team and micro/individual levels are applicable to every hero and team composition. For example, things like ability efficiency, resource management, and cooldown usage apply to heroes like Sigma, Moira, and Genji equally. Reinhardt will always be a brawl/deathball hero, and Zenyatta will always be a high-damage, long-range support. Of course, when the meta changes, the most important thing to remember is those kinds of fundamentals. After that, every small optimization comes from practice and theorycrafting with your teammates.And there you have it - a rollercoaster ride into the world of Overwatch with Jon Miller, our newest addition to the Omnic Data team.

A combination of data analytics and statistical analysis can provide a wealth of invaluable insights into player performance, game mechanics, and optimal strategies. If your esports team or organization isn’t yet capitalizing on the power of data analytics, you are potentially missing out on significant opportunities for growth and success. Partnering with a company that specializes in esports data analytics, like Omnic Data, can help you unlock these benefits and maintain a competitive edge in this ever-evolving landscape.The Changing Face of EsportsThe world of esports is becoming increasingly competitive. Success no longer relies solely on player skill and game knowledge. Instead, it’s about leveraging every tool at your disposal, including the extensive use of data analytics and statistical analysis.

Harnessing this data and translating it into actionable insights can provide your team with the competitive advantage it needs to excel.Why Data Analytics MatterData analytics can provide a wealth of information about player performance. By analyzing the data, we can discern patterns and trends, uncovering insights into what strategies work and which ones don’t. These insights can then inform decision-making, guiding the team’s training focus, game strategy, and team composition.For instance, the recent VALORANT Data Drop report provides a compelling example of how data analytics can be applied to understanding game mechanics, player behavior, and strategies in esports. The report, which compares the effectiveness of two key weapons used by players, reveals fascinating insights. For instance, it finds that the Phantom rifle dominates in close-to-medium-range gunfights, while the Vandal rifle is a popular choice due to its superior damage in the event of a headshot.Such insights are invaluable for players looking to improve their gameplay, highlighting how critical certain weapon choices can be in different game scenarios. This sort of data analysis also informs training decisions, allowing players to focus on mastering the weapons and strategies that give them the best chance of winning.Omnic Data: Your Partner in Esports Data AnalyticsWhile understanding the importance of data analytics is one thing, harnessing its power effectively is another.

As you progress as a player, you start to realize kills and flashiness are nowhere near as important as being a good teammate. It doesn’t matter how many kills you may have, as long as you are doing your job in your role, communicating well, and setting up your team for success, you’re doing a much better job at winning the game, compared to the baiting Reyna or Jett going in third into the site, not communicating, but getting 3 or 4 exit frags before losing the round.What’s the funniest or most embarrassing moment you’ve had while streaming?My most embarrassing moment was likely about five years ago when I was streaming, and got into a pickup game with Brax. I fanboyed a bit too hard and a funny clip came out of it where I got excited because he said my name as a joke.How do you handle the pressure of competing in high-stakes tournaments?Handling pressure in high-stakes tournaments for me was a skill that took a long time to learn. When I first started competing, I would literally get nervous and shake versus the most random teams in 1k open tournaments, or if I had a big pro on my team in ranked games. After a while and lots of experience playing against the biggest teams and biggest names, you kind of just get used to it, and learn to keep your composure. All it took for me was time and experience, and it was actually my biggest issue for a while as nerves affect you much MORE than people think.What’s the most amusing rage quit you’ve ever witnessed during a game?No rage quits. EVER.What advice would you give to aspiring professional Valorant players?The best advice I can give to anyone aspiring to go pro is to give it time, do NOT burn bridges no matter who the person may be, and ALWAYS play to improve. Analyze why you died or lost your game, instead of just thinking “oh, I got unlucky or my team was bad”. There is always something you could have done differently which may have impacted the game’s outcome.What’s the most overrated weapon in Valorant, in your opinion?The Vandal, but only slightly. Even though the Phantom headshots for 140, it’s much more consistent, has no tracers, more bullets, and usually if you headshot someone you will get the kill 99% of the time anyways due to aim-punch on the enemy.How do you balance your personal life and your professional gaming career?I don’t (kind of). Playing pro takes up LARGE amounts of time, even before you are “pro”, and NOTHING is guaranteed. I unfortunately had to sacrifice many things like relationships and school in my life, and even then I still haven’t made it to the level I strive to be at. The best thing to do is make sure you are living healthy. It’s honestly not worth it to go pro since the chance of you “making it” is very minimal, and even if you do “make it”, there is no guarantee you will stay in the scene long. However, if it is something you KNOW you want to do, focus on staying and eating healthy, focus on relationships inside and outside of the game, and balance your grind to make sure you do NOT burn out, as that will kill all of the time you spent getting to where you are.What is the strangest superstition or pre-game ritual that you follow before a match?The “strangest” thing I do before every match/game is that I wash my hands every time during Agent select. I like to keep things consistent and that helps me a lot with consistency to ensure my hand feels the same every time a new game starts. In addition to that, before I warm up for the day, I almost do a full-body stretch, focusing mainly on my hands to make sure they’re nimble and ready to game, haha.Can you share a key moment or turning point in your gaming career that has significantly impacted your success?I honestly got very lucky when it comes to my success. I was playing ranked one day and had St4n add me after the game, asking if I wanted to trial for his team. As soon as he linked me his HLTV, I was down. A day later, we started practice, and my first ever scrim was against Andbox/NYFU at the time. I was VERY nervous, yet we stomped them, and that made me realize that I could potentially do something in Valorant.Join Gucc107 in Nashville on May 27th as Omnic Data partners with Belong Gaming Arenas to unveil the cutting-edge Omnic Forge, an AI-powered esports coaching and data analytics platform that’s set to revolutionize the gaming experience." }, { "title": "Why Pre-Aim Matters in Valorant?", "url": "/posts/Why-Pre-Aim-Matters-in-Valorant/", "categories": "Pre-Aim Techniques and Strategies, Improving Aim through Analysis and Practice", "tags": "Valorant, FPS games, Omnic Forge, Pre-aiming, Aim improvement, Tactical shooters, skill improvement, Crosshair placement, Game strategy, Pro gaming tips", "date": "2023-05-05 09:00:00 -0400", "snippet": "Good aim is important for finding success in any first-person shooter (FPS), but you may have heard more about “pre-aim” or “pre-aiming” in Valorant than in other games like Call of Duty or Overwatch. What is pre-aim and why is it talked about so much in Valorant? Read on to find out what pre-aiming is, why it is valuable, and how you can improve yours.(SPOILER: The Forge has a whole feature dedicated to helping you improve your pre-aim!)Don’t Move, Just ShootValorant falls into the category of a “tactical shooter,” similar to the longstanding classic Counter-Strike. This means the game focuses on slower, precise positioning rather than fast-paced, run-and-gun fighting. Valorant heavily punishes weapon accuracy while moving for most guns; in order to shoot accurately, you have to be standing still. That is why you’ll see pro players stop moving before they start shooting, since once they stop moving there is no accuracy penalty.This also means that a player who isn’t moving has an accuracy advantage over a player who is moving. That is why so many players will “hold an angle” or watch a certain spot to see if any opponents try to move into that area. Since they are not moving and their opponent is moving, they have the advantage of shooting at their opponent accurately while their opponent has to stop moving to shoot back (making them an even easier target).Prepare to FireOf course, you can’t just stand still for the entire game, and you’ll have to push into areas that opponents are watching. So, when you are pushing into an area where you expect opponents to be, you should “pre-aim” at possible locations where opponents could be hiding. This means aiming your crosshair at the spot you want to check before moving into the area.For instance, say you are pushing onto A Site on Ascent. Opponents often like to hold the bottom of the site, typically called “hell,” as seen here.As an attacker, if you just walk onto the site, your crosshair will be somewhere in the center, and you’ll have to move it to shoot at the defender.You have to stop moving, move your crosshair, and then fire, but your opponent just has to move their crosshair and fire, meaning they are more likely to hit their shots and secure an elimination.But let’s say before you walk onto the site, your Sova has darted and revealed that there is an enemy in hell. You want to pre-aim or prepare your crosshair at the same level that the opponent in hell would be before walking onto the site in a manner like this. This is why you’ll sometimes see pro players stare at a wall before moving or swinging out to engage an opponent.(It just so happens that the top of the bricks on the wall gives a pretty good idea of the headshot level of enemies in hell. There are other spots on maps, like some of the boxes on sites, that provide a good visual indication of what head level is and where you should keep your crosshair aimed.)Now, when you move into the entrance to A site, your crosshair is already where you expect the enemy to be. This means you just have to stop and shoot while your opponent (if they didn’t pre-aim) has to move their crosshair and then shoot. Even though you were moving, since your crosshair was pre-aimed, you have the advantage since you just stop and shoot.This is why pre-aiming is so valuable, as it allows you to win against stationary opponents. Of course, there is even more to discuss, such as checking multiple angles (what if you didn’t know if the opponent was in hell or behind the boxes or on the platform above, called “heaven”) and properly moving when pushing into an area to throw off your opponent’s pre-aim (“swinging”). But this covers the basic idea of why pre-aiming is valuable and why the best players in the world are so good at getting eliminations even when moving.How Do You Get Better?The simple answer, like most things, is practice. Keeping your crosshair at a level position takes a lot of practice and time in the game. Of course, sometimes it can be hard to tell if you are improving and what you can do to get better. That’s where Aim Analysis from the Forge comes in.Aim Analysis provides you with the statistics to track how your aim is improving, monitoring the number of times you have properly pre-aimed opponents that enter your screen. It also gives you a visual representation of where opponents appear when they first show up on the screen and which ones you are hitting or not hitting. For example, there was a large number of times opponents appeared on the lower right of my screen that I didn’t shoot at, suggesting I should try aiming a little lower and to the right more often. It is a great tool to help improve your pre-aim, making you a better player who can hit as many shots as Tenz!So that’s pre-aim. Thanks for reading, and make sure to leave a comment on any tips you use to hit your shots. Have a great day!" }, { "title": "Leveling Up Gaming Spaces: The Journey from Internet Cafés to Esports Arenas", "url": "/posts/Leveling-Up-Gaming-Spaces-The-Journey-from-Internet-Caf%C3%A9s-to-Esports-Arenas/", "categories": "Gaming Center Innovations, Omnic Forge and Belong Gaming Collaboration", "tags": "AI coaching, esports, Omnic Forge, Belong Gaming, gaming centers, artificial intelligence, skill improvement, data analytics, gaming innovation, player performance", "date": "2023-04-28 09:00:00 -0400", "snippet": "IntroductionHey there, fellow gamers! We’ve all seen how much the gaming world has changed over the years, right? Remember those days when we’d spend hours at internet cafés just to play our favorite games? Well, let me tell you, gaming hangouts have seriously leveled up. Esports is a big deal now, with the global esports market expected to reach $1.79 billion in revenue by 2023. Dedicated arenas and venues have taken gaming to a whole new level. So, let’s dive into the evolution from internet cafés to today’s esports arenas and venues, including a quick mention of Belong Gaming Arenas.The Internet Café DaysBack in the day, internet cafés were the go-to spot for gaming sessions. You’d pay by the hour, grab a seat, and get your game on. Sure, they had their charm, but they were often cramped, noisy, and not the comfiest places to play. But hey, it was better than nothing, right?Welcome to the World of Esports ArenasAs esports took the world by storm, the need for better gaming spaces became apparent. That’s where esports arenas and venues come in. They’re all about giving gamers and spectators the best experience possible, from hosting tournaments to providing top-notch facilities. In fact, it’s estimated that by 2023, global esports live event revenues will reach $197.7 million, showing the growing demand for these venues.What’s the Deal with Esports Arenas?Esports arenas are like a dream come true for gamers. They’ve got huge screens for spectators, lightning-fast internet connections for smooth gameplay, and immersive sound systems that make you feel like you’re right in the game. Plus, they’ve got comfy seating, VIP areas, and gaming lounges, so you can chill with your friends between matches.A Quick Nod to Belong Gaming ArenasI just have to give a shoutout to Belong Gaming Arenas. These gaming venues are a great example of how esports venues are catering to gamers of all levels.

This guide will recap everything you need to know about enrollment, weekly matches, and tournament play so you don’t miss out on this thrilling gaming experience!EnrollmentEnrollment for the Valorant Premier Beta is open from April 25th to April 28th. Any player can enroll, provided they meet the following requirements: Been ranked at some point in the account’s career, which means completing 5 placement Competitive games. Brand new players will need to level up their account to level 20 before accessing Competitive play. SMS verify their account. This option will be available during the Premier sign-up process, so keep your phone handy. Players can create or join a team consisting of 5 to 7 players. Each player can be a part of only one team. Players of any skill level can be on the same team, but teams will be placed into divisions based on the top 5 players’ cumulative MMR. Inviting a player of significantly higher or lower skill that moves the team out of the division it is currently in will fail; you will have to unenroll the team and re-enroll to play with that player.Team Owners, whoever initially created the team, manage the roster, including canceling invites and removing players from the team. Rosters are set once weekly matches begin on April 29th, so make sure you have your team finalized before then. Team Owners also select the zone where the team’s matches will be played which determines in what region your matches will be played and at what times. Owners can see the zones with the best average ping when selecting to pick what’s best for their team. Matches will be played on the same latency rules as competitive, so no team will get an inherent advantage.Important: If you miss enrollment, you won’t be able to participate in the beta!Weekly MatchesWeekly matches run from April 29th to May 20th with 1 to 2 matches per week. Each match will be against a team in your division on that week’s featured map in the Premier hub, from which you also queue as a team for matches. There is a time window for teams to queue for matches each week and it’s best to queue early in the window for optimal results. Queues shouldn’t take longer than 8 minutes, but queuing later in the window could result in longer queues or not finding a match.Matches play out like regular competitive games, except for overtime. In Overtime, the first team to reach 12 points picks the starting side. Teams must win by 2 points and swap sides each round. If 2 sets of Overtime have been played and the score is still tied, a final Sudden Death round is played (the first team to 12 points chooses their starting side).Winning a match earns 100 points, losing earns 25 points, and not queuing or playing earns 0 points.Tournament PlayTeams that accrue 375 points over their weekly matches qualify for the tournament. All qualifying teams in a division will be matched into a bracket of 8 teams. Brackets are Bo1 (best of one), with one winner emerging from each bracket. Losing teams enter the consolation bracket for 3rd place.During the tournament, before a match teams take turns picking and banning maps, similar to professional play. The process alternates between the teams until a map is chosen; the team that didn’t choose the map decides whether to attack or defend first.Bracket winners will earn a unique player card and title. All Premier participants will also receive a player card and title after the beta ends. Rewards can be redeemed the day after winning or when the beta ends in the collections screen.Grab your friends and get ready for some fun matches! This guide should get you up and running, but you can check out the Valorant Premier FAQ for more information. Good luck, and may the best team win!" }, { "title": "Expert Insights: AI Coaching for Gamers - A Q&A with an Omnic Data Developer", "url": "/posts/Expert-Insights-AI-Coaching-for-Gamers-A-Q&A-with-an-Omnic-Data-Developer/", "categories": "Omnic Data, Q&A", "tags": "Valorant, AI Coaching, Gaming Industry, Fortnite, Computer Vision, Game Analytics, Player Improvement, Artificial Intelligence, Developer Insights, Competitive Gaming, Esports", "date": "2023-04-14 09:00:00 -0400", "snippet": "Welcome to our exclusive Q&amp;A blog featuring insights from Nat Youngren a developer at Omnic Data, who is part of the team behind the innovative AI coaching platform Omnic Forge for Fortnite and Valorant. In this discussion, we explore the challenges, successes, and future of AI-driven coaching in gaming, as well as some light-hearted fun questions. Join us as we delve into the developer’s perspective on revolutionizing player growth and strategy through cutting-edge AI technology.How do you adapt computer vision technology to recognize and analyze the unique gameplay elements of Fortnite and Valorant?The field of computer vision has seen so many advances recently that the hardest part is often just keeping track of available technologies and applying them correctly to the tasks at hand.The good news is that games across many genres share universal design elements, aimed at making these games easier for human players to pick up and learn at a glance. Game designers put a lot of thought into exposing information to a human player through visual cues, HUD elements, and consistent silhouette/color patterns.Each game comes with unique considerations, but most problems can be generalized into a combination of detection, classification, and/or text analysis.What challenges have you faced in developing an AI model that can provide relevant and actionable feedback for players across two distinct games?There are a lot of tricky factors to consider, it can really feel like a balancing act. We actually have much more data available to us than we require to train AI analysis, and we work with both professional players and human coaches to inform our approach to each individual game. AI is capable of identifying an incredible range of patterns, but the ultimate goal is to train and frame that analysis in a way that can assist HUMAN players in the improvement process.How has the AI’s analysis helped professional players to refine their strategies and boost their performance?With such dramatic TTK, the name of the game in Valorant is pre-aim, which requires map knowledge, disciplined control over your crosshair, and a keen sense of your opponents whereabouts. Through identifying and tracking onscreen player entities Forge is able to provide detail about a player’s ability to enter engagements with the best possible chance of winning.Professional players can use this data to identify points of weakness, and with their feedback we will continue to present our data in new and informative ways.Can you discuss the process of creating training data for the AI from actual gameplay footage?A significant portion of my work has been spent crafting tools which optimize the development process. To this point, we now have an indispensable toolbox of training data utilities which allow us to easily convert video files into sampled frames, then further crop, sort, label, and organize that data to suit whatever detectors we are currently working on. Since the computer vision pipeline we have developed is largely a generalized framework, the process of implementing those detectors is almost drag-and-drop once the training is complete.How do you ensure that the data is diverse and representative?As with most AI technology, this is something we have to carefully approach. Games support accessibility options, HUD scaling, various languages, cosmetic customization, and a vast array of screen resolutions, to name only a few of the possible issues. Our goal is to maximize our coverage of these options whenever possible. A simple example, from Valorant, would be building our training data to include the range the possible enemy highlight colors. The good news is that modern computer vision is fully capable of handling variation. Our models typically become more attuned to the nuance of our detection targets when we expand the data to encompass these options, and we see improved accuracy across the board.A reality of computer vision is that perfection will always be unattainable, but our models can only improve as we continue to identify edge cases and expand our coverage.What do you think the future holds for AI-driven coaching in the gaming industry, particularly for games like Fortnite and Valorant?Personally, I think AI is an inevitability for the gaming industry. We have all seen the conquest of reinforcement learning in so many genres of gaming, from chess to DOTA 2 (a personal favorite). AI is already incredible at optimization and self-improvement, but the next frontier is exploring how we can best apply AI to our own individual progress.If the AI could form a dream team with famous characters from Fortnite and Valorant, who would be on the roster and why?Out of innate robotic sympathy I would have to say Kitbash and Oppressor from Fortnite, and obviously KAY/O. But between you, me, and all the duelist spammers out there, I believe Reyna is in more of our training games than any other agent. Forge might appreciate the familiar face.Have you ever witnessed the AI getting “confused” by unusual in-game antics or strategies? Tell us about that amusing experience.I remember when I was working with our inventory and economy data, and I was just about to tear my hair out over some ridiculous results. I really thought I’d have to rebuild the detector again with more training data. Turns out the player was simply blowing his last-round credits and flinging guns back and forth with his teammates. Honestly, I was impressed after I found out, as the detectors captured everything just fine. Those sorts of behaviors can ultimately be confusing to an AI so I made sure to account for that in the backend.If the AI were to create a Fortnite skin or Valorant agent based on its own personality, what would it look like and what would its special abilities be?If the AI were to create a Fortnite skin? I consider Forge to be an everyman, he’d wear the default skin but downgraded to a grainy and consistent 720p. Nothing pretentious. As for Valorant, I think Forge would prefer zero bullet deviation and an ultimate that deletes Yoru from the game, that clone is not computer-vision friendly!We hope this Q&amp;A with Nat Youngren has sparked your curiosity about the potential of AI coaching in gaming. We invite you to try out Omnic Forge and experience the benefits of AI-driven analysis firsthand. As the gaming industry continues to evolve, so does our approach to enhancing player performance. Stay tuned for more exciting installments in this series, as we keep exploring the cutting-edge intersection of AI and gaming.

Since his release, Omnic Forge users have won 63% of their games with him! In this post, we’ll provide a breakdown of Gekko’s abilities and how to best utilize them in the current meta. Read on to learn more!Gekko’s AbilitiesAs a new agent, Gekko brings a fresh set of abilities to the table. Here’s a breakdown of what you can expect:Q - Wingman: Imagine Raze’s Boombot, but cuter. Wingman can be deployed to seek out enemies, stunning the first one he sees. If Gekko is holding the spike, Wingman can be used to plant the spike in a location or be sent to defuse it on defense. Once used, Wingman turns into a blob that Gekko can reclaim to use again.E - Dizzy: Gekko’s default ability, Dizzy acts like Skye’s flash. Toss Dizzy and she will blind any enemies in line of sight with a plasma-goo blast. Like his other abilities, Gekko can reclaim the orb where she drops to reuse her.C - Mosh Pit: One-shot molotov. Mosh is tossed like a grenade into then spreads out upon landing. After a short delay, anyone in the pit is hit with 150 damage.X - Thrash: It’s Killjoy’s Lockdown mixed with Skye’s Pathfinder. Thrash is steerable once deployed and when it jumps at an enemy, she explodes detaining anyone caught in the blast radius. The best part: Gekko can collect the orb where she exploded to reuse it again.How to Play GekkoIf you’re looking to add Gekko to your Valorant roster, here are some tips on how to best utilize his abilities:Expect Gekko to play a lot like Skye. He can help lead the charge onto a site but quickly runs out of utility if he doesn’t recollect his orbs. His flash is team-safe (can’t accidentally flash teammates) making him great for pushing with his Duelist(s) and Wingman is a great tool to plant/defuse the spike while Gekko engages any enemies nearby. The importance of collecting his orbs to keep up his utility means he plays a little slower than other Initiators but still packs a mean punch.Is Gekko Broken?In short, no. Expect Gekko to slot into the secondary Initiator slot that Skye usually fills, playing alongside some other Initiator that has better recon abilities. He has the smallest ability inventory, meaning if he can’t pick up his buddies he burns through his utility very quickly; if his team can’t take the space made through using these abilities, he’ll be in a rough spot. Overall, until we have seen more of him, he starts off in B-tier as a good situational pick to back up another Initiator but isn’t always going to find success.For more information on Valorant gameplay and strategy, check out other blog posts on our website.

The tournament attracted an impressive 1.43 million peak viewers and an average of around 430,000, with over 100 hours of on-air time, according to Esports Charts.The VCT LOCK//IN São Paulo was the second-most-watched event in Valorant’s short history, featuring 32 teams from all three main regions of the game: EMEA, Pacific, and Americas. It was designed as a way to start the new VCT season officially and showcase all the teams set to participate in the VALORANT regional leagues.Fnatic, the UK-based organization, emerged as the champions after defeating LOUD in a thrilling Grand Final. The Brazilian team, which had home support in São Paulo, gave their all and managed to attract the most viewers to their matches. Interestingly, three of their matches were among the top six most-watched of the tournament.Despite LOUD’s impressive performance, Fnatic won the VCT LOCK//IN São Paulo in dramatic fashion, with a comeback from an 11-3 deficit in the final map, Icebox, to win the series in overtime.While the VCT LOCK//IN São Paulo was well-received, some fans and pundits criticized the event for having most matches in a best-of-one format, which may have limited viewership numbers as teams were eliminated after a single loss.Nevertheless, the tournament showcased some of the most exciting and innovative gameplay in the Valorant scene, with teams experimenting with new strategies and compositions. Additionally, the event was co-streamed by Riot Games-selected partners and had over 200 channels covering the tournament on various platforms and languages.With Fnatic’s victory in the VCT LOCK//IN São Paulo, Timofey ‘Chronicle’ Khromov became the first player to win two VCT trophies. Khromov, who was also part of the Gambit squad that won VCT Stage 3 Masters in Berlin in 2021, will be a player to watch in the upcoming VCT circuit.Overall, the VCT LOCK//IN São Paulo provided a thrilling start to the 2023 Valorant Champions Tour, offering fans and esports enthusiasts a glimpse of what’s to come in the world of Valorant esports. It was a competitive and exciting tournament, setting the stage for what promises to be an unforgettable year for Valorant esports." }, { "title": "Valorant 6.03: Tier List Update", "url": "/posts/valorant-6.03-tier-list-update/", "categories": "Valorant, Tier List", "tags": "Valorant, VCT, Controllers, Initiators, Duelists, Sentinels, esports, Agents, Breach, Skye, KAY/O, Fade, Sova, Harbor, Astra, Brimstone, Omen, Viper, Killjoy, Chamber, Cypher, Sage, Yoru, Reyna, Phoenix, Neon, Raze, Jett", "date": "2023-03-03 11:10:00 -0500", "snippet": "As Lock//in 2023 comes to a close and 6.03 has had some time to sink in, it’s time to update our tier lists to reflect the changes in the meta.As a reminder:S - Near must pick, offers a clear advantage over the othersA - Very good pick that still offers a lotB - Okay pick that can work in some situationsC - Less successful pick that will usually struggleSentinelsKilljoy gets bumped down due to the 6.03 nerfs, as the weaker turret and more expensive ult reduce her clear dominance over other sentinels. Sage and Cypher remain solid picks and both have seen time on the stage in São Paulo. Another looming presence is the return of Chamber; Killjoy’s drop in power and Lotus’s close-quarter design has made the French agent more viable, although he still feels the effects of his nerf that prevents him from dominating again. To find out more about our initial rankings, read the original tier list notes here!DuelistsJett now sits alone at the top as Raze’s BoomBot nerfs in 6.03 turn her into a simply solid pick (but don’t let that fool you as she remains very strong). Phoenix and Neon have seen some time on the stage and remain good options. Reyna remains the “smurf agent” that is dominant when a player has excellent aim but struggles otherwise. Yoru moves up to the plausible tier with a few appearances in Challengers and São Paulo but is still a mechanically challenging and situational pick. To find out more about our initial rankings, read the original tier list notes here!ControllersNot much changed for the controller role. The top three of Viper, Omen, and Brimstone remain solid picks on any map, even must-picks on some. Astra has shown strong performances in pro play, but still isn’t reliable enough to be a solid overall pick. Harbor has been a big surprise in Lock//in and has seen a lot of usage on Pearl in particular. He may not be as bad as originally thought, but he is still a situational pick. To find out more about our initial rankings, read the original tier list notes here!InitiatorsNot much to say here. Sova remains king because of his synergy with Jett and Shock Bolts are now more effective against Killjoy’s weaker turret. KAY/O and Fade remain where they are due to their varied utility.

For the less-professional Valorant player, Season 6 brings with it a new opportunity to climb the ranks and finally reach the rank of your dreams.Patch 5.12 brought a huge shakeup with Chamber’s rework opening up the door for true duelists to return to the spotlight.Scaling up utility health while decreasing utility damage, along with the removal of Breeze and Bind and the addition of Lotus into the competitive rotation, the initiator meta has drastically changed.Luckily, I’ve ranked the best initiators to play right now with the following tiers!S - Near must pick, offers a clear advantage over the othersA - Very good pick that still offers a lotB - Okay pick that can work in some situationsC - Less successful pick that will usually struggleBreach - BChanges - Increased the cost of Rolling Thunder to 8 ultimate points.Strengths - Breach’s kit excels at disrupting and displacing enemies, making him great for pushing into an area. He is one of the best initiators for clearing corners, as any of his abilities can effectively disable an enemy so it can be cleared. Rolling Thunder is a great initiation ultimate for taking or re-taking a site. He is honestly a pushing team’s dream.Weaknesses - The major downside is half his kit requires a wall or cover to be used. This can make it hard for him to get the maximum value and presents a challenge for newer players. Focusing on firepower, he has no recon abilities, making it hard to convert if he doesn’t know where enemies are and easy to waste abilities on an empty site. Lastly, while still encumbering, stuns are not as effective as blinds at disabling players.Overall - Breach is a good secondary initiator to supplement your team with strong pushing power. His unique playstyle can be challenging for new players and his lack of recon abilities hurts his viability, but when the situation calls for firepower, he’s your man. Read on to find some initiators who don’t need as much experience to succeed.Skye - BChanges - Trailblazer’s cost was increased to 300 credits while Regrowth was reduced to 150.Strengths - Skye is a solid jack of all trades, able to flash, heal, and recon, which makes her able to single-handedly support a push onto a site. Her flash is good for getting information (as her voice line will reveal if any players were flashed), it also has the ability to recharge over time. She excels at split-pushing sites or supporting her team from the back.Weaknesses - Jack of all trades, master of none. While Skye has varied utility, all of it is slow. Particularly the Trailblazer leaves her vulnerable while scouting, relying on nearby teammates for defense. Her flash does take time to reliably master and the risk of team flashing is always a danger. Her Seekers are also underwhelming as they randomly hunt down nearby enemies but are easily destroyed and can be hard to follow up on.Overall - Skye offers a lot of varied utility that excels when playing off her team. Her diverse kit means she can support a split-push easily or be backing up a duelist diving into site, but her slower deploy time for utility, plus the Pathfinder cost increase, can make it hard for her to push into a site first. She is a good supplemental initiator, but read on to see which initiators are even stronger.KAY/O - AChanges - Increased Zero Point’s health in line with the other utility changes and NULL/cmd was increased to 8 ultimate points.Strengths - KAY/O is another jack of all trades, with recon, a molotov, and flashes. His ability to suppress opponents is very strong for shutting down sentinel setups, particularly for Chamber’s and Jett’s ultimates. He can clear corners with his flash or molotov, making it easy for him to push onto the site. His varied utility makes him good at supporting pushes and taking space.Weaknesses - KAY/O’s biggest weakness is his skill gap. Mastering his flashes can be hard and team-flashing, again, is always a risk. Knowing lineups is valuable information, meaning it can take time and practice for players to get the most out of him.Overall - With the rise of Killjoy, KAY/O gets a bump in power as he can reliably disable or destroy her setups. While it can take time to master and his recent ultimate cost increase doesn’t help, his kit is incredibly strong, making him a solid initiator. Read on to see who else can offer such good value.Fade - AChanges - Prowler’s health was reduced to 60 HP.Strengths - Fade is great at getting information, whether it be with her Watcher or clearing corners with her Prowler. Her Prowlers being able to track down marked enemies gives her an opening to enter onto sites, while her Seize acts a sudo-molotov to stop enemies from pushing an area. Nightfall is excellent for taking or retaking a site, making her an overall solid agent for pushing.Weaknesses - Fade lacks a proper molotov, meaning she can’t disrupt a sentinel setup. Especially with the Prowler health decrease, her kit is vulnerable to being destroyed before it can get value and her Watcher’s throw range isn’t as far as you think, meaning studying lineups are a must.Overall - Fade is a good pushing agent whose utility is quick to grasp. While destructible, her utility can get her team on the site or at least track down any enemies. She is a solid initiator pick, but read on to see who our best initiator is right now.Sova - SChanges - Recon Bolt’s health was increased in line with other utility changes.Strengths - Sova is the king of recon. Between his Recon Bolt and drone, he can quickly find enemies on the site so his team can push in. Shock Bolts give him the opportunity to destroy enemy utility, check corners, or play post-plant situations. His ultimate is an easy way to get an opening pick on a site if an enemy gets tagged.Weaknesses - He lacks a stun or flash, making it hard for him to lead the charge onto a site. He is reliant on his team for playing off the information he gets and his recon bolt and drone can both be destroyedOverall - With the recent Fade and KAY/O nerfs, Sova is the best initiator. His kit is easy to pick up with room to be mastered through countless lineups. While he relies on his team for follow-up, he presents opportunities for skilled players to make cool plays with his excellent recon abilities. Definitely try picking up the Russian archer if you are looking to climb right now.Thoughts? Disagree?

For the less-professional Valorant player, Season 6 brings with it a new opportunity to climb the ranks and finally reach the rank of your dreams.Luckily, I’ve ranked the best sentinels to play right now with the following tiers!S - Near must pick, offers a clear advantage over the othersA - Very good pick that still offers a lotB - Okay pick that can work in some situationsC - Less successful pick that will usually struggleHarbor - CChanges - Harbor’s smoke durations were buffed, with his High Tide and Cascade now on par timewise with Viper’s wall and orb.Strengths - Harbor offers a more flexible playstyle than Viper as his wall can be deployed at any point of the match (and recharges after 40 seconds) and can be curved around the site to cut off multiple chokepoints. He is good at taking or retaking sites with Cascade and his ultimate, while Cove offers unique opportunities to play on the spike.Weaknesses - Harbor doesn’t control vision as much or as long as the other controllers on this list. Furthermore, his kit lacks any utility, like a molotov, to destroy utility and his ultimate is weaker than other site-clearing ultimates. As the newest agent, his unique more aggressive playstyle presents a learning curve for new players and makes it hard to maximize his value.Overall - Harbor presents a unique suite of abilities, but they are hard to master. He doesn’t offer as much utility as the other agents on this list and his learning curve leaves him in a very niche position. While he could break out in the future, for this season look toward the other agents if you’re looking to climb.Astra - BChanges - Untouched by 5.12.Strengths - Astra has a global reach, able to place a smoke anywhere on the map at any time. In addition to smoking off a site, her Gravity Well is a valuable post-plant tool to deny diffuses and, if timed properly, her Nova Pulse can stun and stop a push in its tracks. The flexibility to turn a star into any of these, plus being able to recall stars that aren’t properly placed, gives her the ability to adapt to the enemies’ strategy and her ultimate can seal off the whole map if placed well.Weaknesses - Astra requires stars to be well-placed to get good value. Placing stars requires her to enter Astral Form, leaving her vulnerable if enemies are nearby. She lacks utility outside of her stars, meaning if she runs out of stars, she is unable to offer anything else to her team.Overall - Astra is an okay controller who has seen increased pick-rate at the pro level on some maps. Her stars are flexible and powerful, but misplacing them or running out leaves her with nothing to offer her team. While not as challenging a pick as Harbor, read on to see some of the better agents to climb with.Brimstone - AChanges - Brimstone’s molotov now damages most utilities, including Killjoy’s and Chamber’s.Strengths - Brimstone is a good beginner controller because he offers smokes on demand. He can quickly place long-lasting smokes that are hard to push through (since they aren’t hollow), making him good at controlling vision. His molotov is great for post-plant or clearing an area while his ultimate is one of the best tools to clear out a section of the map.Weaknesses - Brimstone’s smokes are limited in range, meaning he has to be closer to the area he wants to smoke. He only has 3 smokes maximum, meaning he is out once they are used, and he can’t cover long stretches of a site without committing multiple smokes.Overall - Brimstone is a solid controller right now. Especially with the removal of Breeze, he does well on the smaller maps that play into his limited range and his additional utility offers more to his team than just vision control. Still, read on for the other top-tier controllers.Omen - AChanges - Omen’s Paranoia was reduced in cost from 300 to 250 in 5.12.Strengths - Omen excels on deception. He can place smokes globally with a supply that regenerates over time, allowing him to support teammates across the map. His Paranoia is helpful for clearing corners when pushing out while his teleport gives him the opportunity for creative plays or taking the high ground. His ultimate toys with opponents by forcing them to worry about the possibility of a flank and can get information on a tightly held sight.Weaknesses - Placing Omen’s smokes quickly can take some time to master and he is vulnerable while he places them. His ultimate can’t force enemies off a site or areas like Brimstone’s or Viper’s, and his hollow smokes are easier to push through than others. Positioning is key for Omen, as a misplaced teleport can expose him to enemy fire.Overall - Omen is a solid controller with a global smoke range and mobility options for creative players. He can’t force enemies off an area as effectively as Brimstone or Viper, but he does play with his opponent’s minds to give his team an advantage. Of course, check out our final controller before deciding if Omen is your agent to main.Viper - AChanges - Viper’s ultimate was increased in cost to 8 orbs, while the time she can spend outside of the ultimate before it dissipates is reduced to nudge her towards playing in her ultimate more. Her Snakebite now damages utility in line with the other utility changes.Strengths - Viper offers a well-balanced kit. Her wall cuts off large sections of the map while her orb acts as an on-hand smoke. Snakebite is strong for clearing corners or post-plant and her ultimate is great for making it hard for an enemy to push into an area. The ability to toggle the wall and orb with rechargeable smoke gives her some of the best uptime for her smokes while opening up the option for creative plays.Weaknesses - Viper’s smokes may have high uptime, but they have rigid placement; the wall can’t be replaced and she needs to pick up her orb to reuse it. Since her smokes are active abilities, they’re disabled immediately if she is killed or disabled by Kay/o. Players have to be careful with their timing, as running out of gas right when pushing a site will drop the wall and orb, leaving her team exposed.Overall - Viper is a solid controller for holding an area. Her rechargeable vision coverage, despite being dependent on placement, is strong and her other utility is immensely helpful for the team. She is a good pick, but so are Brimstone and Omen.Thoughts?

For the less-professional Valorant player, Season 6 brings with it a new opportunity to climb the ranks and finally reach the rank of your dreams.For my fellow Sentinel mains out there, Patch 5.12 brought a huge shakeup with Chamber’s rework and scaling up utility health while decreasing utility damage. Along with the removal of Breeze and Bind and the addition of Lotus into the competitive rotation, the Sentinel meta has drastically changed.Luckily, I’ve ranked the best sentinels to play right now with the following tiers!S - Near must pick, offers a clear advantage over the othersA - Very good pick that still offers a lotB - Okay pick that can work in some situationsC - Less successful pick that will usually struggleYoru - CChanges - Only Yoru’s gatecrash was altered, its health was reduced to 60 (in line with the other utility debuffs) while its cost was reduced to 150 credits.Strengths - Perhaps no agent best utilizes the advantage of surprise as Yoru. The ability to teleport opens up the ability for tricky positioning plays and flanking opponents for easy kills. His decoy and flashes are good engagement tools for pushing into an area and his ultimate is great for scouting a site and locating the enemy or setting up flanks.Weaknesses - Yoru lives on the element of surprise, meaning the more opponents learn to counterplay by not shooting the clone or tracking teleports, the harder it can be to find value. Furthermore, compared to the other agents on this list, Yoru’s kit requires more skill at an entry level, with his flashes having to bounce before activating and teleport placement being crucial, creating a steeper learning curve.Overall - While Yoru can be a menace in the right hands, most players won’t be able to find the most value. His unique kit creates interesting opportunities for players that are willing to commit the time to learn him, but without a substantial buff from 5.12, he remains a niche pick with typically the lowest win rate across most ranks. You’re probably better off trying one of the agents ahead.Reyna - BChanges - Untouched by 5.12.Strengths - Reyna is the best snowball duelist that rewards players who get kills. Her leer is a good blind that can pass through walls and her orbs allow her to easily play off of kills. She can buy aggressively since her heal will restore her to 150 health and her dismiss can get her out of sticky situations.Weaknesses - Her greatest strength is also her greatest weakness. If she can’t get a kill, she can’t activate half of her kit. Leer’s range is limited and it is destructible, making it less reliable than a flash. Where the duelists above her have a utility that is still viable even if they aren’t getting kills, Reyna is so kill-focused that a struggling player will find little to no value.Overall - Players that are good at getting kills will be most rewarded playing Reyna. She can snowball picks into more kills, but if she can’t get that initial pick she will struggle without utility to make up for it. While not a bad pick, the other duelists above her offer more utility even if they aren’t at the top of the scoreboard.Phoenix - AChanges - The cost of Phoenix’s flash was reduced from 200 credits to 150, making it easier to buy full utility.Strengths - Phoenix is a good entry-level duelist that is great at taking space. He has a solid flash to clear corners and his wall excels at cutting off angles. His molotov can both clear areas or be used to heal him while his ultimate is cheap and a great way to take an area with the advantage of an extra life.Weaknesses - While a solid pick, Phoenix doesn’t offer anything particularly unique. He lacks a great mobility option, making it harder to disengage from a losing fight. While his ultimate is strong, it can be waited out or potentially flanked by enemies, meaning it has to be used with care.Overall - Phoenix is a solid pick for a new duelist player or to cover all the utility bases expected of a duelist. While he lacks mobility, he excels at taking space and is a good addition to most teams. Still, read on to see even better options.Neon - AChanges - Untouched by 5.12.Strengths - Neon is the fastest agent available. Her passive makes it easy to quickly move across the map or move onto site. Her wall cuts off angles while her stun makes it easy to clear corners. Her ultimate is immensely powerful, allowing her to run and gun, a hard-to-hit target dishing out strong damage.Weaknesses - Neon does best engaging which is her best strength, but also can lead her into sticky situations. Sprinting into the enemies will result in a quick death, as she lacks a great disengage other than running away. Her stun also affects allies and the double-bounce can be hard to master.Overall - Neon uses speed to overwhelm the enemy. In the right hands, enemies won’t know what hit them, but being too brazen will quickly end any Neon player’s run. She is a great high-mobility duelist but read on to see which duelists top the list.Raze - SChanges - Raze’s boombot was reduced to 60 HP while her blast packs were increased to 20 HP in line with the other utility changes.Strengths - Raze’s whole kit is about dealing damage. Her blast packs give her excellent mobility to enter a site while her boombot and grenade can clear out enemies hiding in corners. All her utility is easy to use for new players but still offers plenty of room for masters to show off their skills. No other agent can match her raw damage and it’s hard to beat a one-shot rocket launcher for an ultimate.Weaknesses - The main downside of Raze is her lack of disengage once she commits to a fight, lacking a smoke, dismiss, or teleport if she gets in a rough position. Her blast packs can also take time to master as can adapting to her fast playstyle.Overall - Raze is currently one of the two best duelists in the game. Her high mobility with blast packs opens up the opportunity to use low-cost, close-range weapons like the Stinger if needed, while the rest of her kit reliably deals out damage. Her damage-based kit is especially helpful with the resurgence of Killjoy and Cypher as sentinel picks. Any duelist player should try picking her up or try the other top duelist right now.Jett - SChanges - Untouched by 5.12.Strengths - Jett is the wind embodied, offering the most mobility of any agent. Her dash gives her less risky peaks on contested angles while her updraft gives creative players the chance to make cool plays. Her smoke is a great way to enter onto site or to disengage from a losing fight, meaning she isn’t forced to commit to bad fights. Her ultimate gives her the chance to run and gun or an opportunity to save for a round to restore economic balance. She does everything a duelist needs to do well.Weaknesses - Jett’s high mobility is a double-edged sword as inexperienced players can quickly find themselves mispositioned. She does lean towards a more aggressive playstyle with mobility making up most of her kit, meaning a passive player may not be able to get as much value out of her as other duelists.Overall - Jett is the other best duelist in the meta right now. Her mobility gives her the ability to enter the site and follow up on initiator utility. Her dash makes the Operator especially dangerous in her hands and her smoke, unique for the role, helps her enter sites where Killjoy or Cypher may be set up. She is a well-rounded duelist who players should try out when she is strong right now.Thoughts? Disagree? Want to hear our thoughts about the sentinel role (click here!)?

For the less-professional Valorant player, Season 6 brings with it a new opportunity to climb the ranks and finally reach the rank of your dreams.For my fellow Sentinel mains out there, Patch 5.12 brought a huge shakeup with Chamber’s rework and scaling up utility health while decreasing utility damage. Along with the removal of Breeze and Bind and the addition of Lotus into the competitive rotation, the Sentinel meta has drastically changed.Luckily, I’ve ranked the best sentinels to play right now with the following tiers!S - Near must pick, offers a clear advantage over the othersA - Very good pick that still offers a lotB - Okay pick that can work in some situationsC - Less successful pick that will usually struggleChamber - CChanges - The rework has dethroned the golden king. The teleporter rework forces him to play more conservatively while a variety of other nerfs weaken his Headhunter, Trademark, and Tour de Force. Trademark now has an activation range, just like Killjoy’s turret, and coupled with the short-range teleport anchor, it forces him to play on a single site or area, greatly reducing his previous power to roam.Strengths - Chamber is still very good at getting economic value for players with good aim, as his Headhunter is still a one-shot headshot at 150 creds a bullet and Tour de Force is essentially a free Operator. His teleporter is still a way to freely peek open areas with an easy out, although the shorter range and long cooldown forces players to position more strategically.Weaknesses - Chamber cannot lock down a site or deny entry as effectively as the other sentinels. The limited range of Trademark and Rendevous force him to play in a single area, but if pushed with utility, he struggles to find value. His utility revolves around the player hitting their shots, meaning effective smokes or flashes easily pushes him back.Overall - Chamber will struggle to find a spot. He remains a good option for players with good aim that want to peek angles but lacks the utility to effectively hold his ground, turning him into a glass cannon. With the lowest win rate of any sentinel this act across most ranks, try to avoid the French weapon designer in favor of the others on this list.Sage - AChanges - Sage saw two changes in 5.12, the first a minor delay in her wall being created and the second a rework of her heal to make her more team-oriented. Rather than doing a flat 60 HP, the heal now restores allies to full while only restoring 30 HP to herself. This encourages players to stay with and heal teammates, rather than trying to go off on their own.Strengths - Sage’s wall is still the best single ability that isn’t an ultimate to physically block off a choke point. Her heal is now even better at keeping allies in the fight, especially useful in pistol rounds, and her slow orbs are excellent at delaying pushes.Weaknesses - Sage’s utility is less useful for entering a site. Where Cypher and Killjoy can use their camera and turret respectively to check corners or smokes, Sage cannot and has to rely on teammates’ utility or peek. Similarly, while she has her wall, she can’t watch multiple flanks or chokepoints for the extended period of time a turret or trip wire can.Overall - Sage remains a solid pick that compliments most team compositions. On some maps, like Icebox, her wall remains one of the most powerful abilities while her new heal makes her more helpful to her team, despite being unable to watch multiple flanks. With a win rate usually hovering around 50%, Sage players should feel good this season, but if you want to try something a little more powerful, read on.Cypher - AChanges - Cypher was mostly untouched by 5.12, the only change being an increase in tripwire health up to 20 HP.Strengths - With few changes, Cypher remains the best sentinel at spotting enemies. With the Chamber rework, he is the only sentinel with global utility (unless you want to count Sage’s wall staying up). His camera can be accessed anywhere on the map while his tripwires can cover any flank. Cyber cages are great on-hand smokes or useful in setups to hold down a site. With only a 6-orb ultimate, he can frequently reveal enemies to help his team secure rounds.Weaknesses - Cypher gets information, but does little actual damage to enemies. Failure to communicate with their team reduces the value of information and if Cypher dies early, it exposes his team to flanks. In addition, while Cypher’s ultimate is cheap, it requires a kill and close access to the body, meaning it can be hard to get off.Overall - Cypher is great at securing flanks and tracking where enemies are or aren’t. He offers more offensive information-gathering options than a Sage with his camera, but still excels when he can set up in an area. A solid pick to fill out any team comp, he only pales when compared to the current queen of the sentinels.Killjoy - SChanges - The utility damage reduction has benefited Killjoy the most out of all the sentinels. Not only is less damage done to her turret and alarm bot by utility, but her Lockdown was increased to 200 health. This increase prevents it from being broken by Breach’s Aftershock and requires a direct hit from KAY/O’s molly to fully break it.Strengths - Killjoy has always been good at locking down a site and the 5.12 patch just makes her better at that. An alarm bot vulnerable plus nano swarm damage can chunk enemies down while her turret can be a nuisance to clear, especially in eco or half-buy rounds. Even on attack, she excels at covering flanks and can check corners or smokes with her turret. Her ultimate lives up to its name and successfully clears a site for 15 seconds. On attack, that is a third of the time the spike needs to detonate while on defense it is plenty of time to defuse.Weaknesses - Like Cypher, Killjoy is at her best when she can set up and be pushed on the site she sets up. This means she can struggle having to rotate, although the ability to recall her bots makes it doable. Her limited activation range also comes into effect, especially if trying to cover long flanks, and her ultimate can be destroyed if not safely positioned. Lastly, her bots rely on contact to activate, meaning it is harder to determine if the enemy commits down a flank being covered or has turned around.Overall - Killjoy is currently the best sentinel due to the buff to Lockdown and the rework of utility damage. She can hold a site like no other and the removal of Breeze, arguably her weakest map, has bumped her up in priority. With a healthy win rate, Killjoy mains rejoice in this time of great feasting while other sentinel players may want to pick up the German wonder girl to climb the ranks.Thoughts? Disagree?

But an aspiring team has a long way to go, so today we’ll break down the path to get there.Open QualifierFor the majority of teams, their ticket into Challengers would come from successful bid at one of two open tournaments happening this January. From the 9th to the 13th and the 17th to the 23rd, teams have the chance to earn one of 6 spots into Challengers (4 from the first tournament, 2 from the second). For each tournament, the team plays through a 3-round single-elimination bracket before the remaining teams are reseeded into a 32-team, double-elimination bracket where the winners earn the slots. (Of course, if you were invited, you skip this step like G2, TSM, FaZe, M80, The Guard, &amp; Shopify Rebellion in NA Challengers).ChallengersAfter a team wins a slot to challengers, the hard work really begins. Challengers consist of 12 teams battling it out across a regular split, a mid-season tournament, and a second regular split. Scoring points based on their performance at each step, the top 8 teams move into the playoffs, from which the top 2 move on to the Ascension tournament.Ascension TournamentThe final step for any aspiring team, the Ascension Tournament is a global competition where the best challengers teams from across the world meet to compete for a franchise spot in the global league. The best-performing team for each region (Americas, EMEA, &amp; Pacific) will win the ascension slot for that region and become the 11th global team in each region.If your favorite team doesn’t ascend this year, don’t fret: Riot intends to ascend a team every year for the foreseeable future, and the new in-game competitive system that is coming down the line will make it easier for new teams to rise to the top.Stay tuned for more updates and make sure to check out Omnic Forge if you want to start improving your Valorant gameplay to make your own run at ascension." }, { "title": "Record Breaking Viewership for the LoL Worlds and OWL Grand Finals", "url": "/posts/record-breaking-viewership-for-the-lol-worlds-and-owl-grand-finals/", "categories": "Esports, News", "tags": "League of Legends, LoL Worlds 2022, T1, DRX, Overwatch, OWL, Grand Finals 2022, Riot Games, San Fransico Shock, Dallas Fuel", "date": "2022-11-28 12:17:00 -0500", "snippet": "The past month has been an exciting time for esports fans across the globe as the Overwatch League Grand Finals and League of Legends World Championships were held the first weekend of November. Overwatch and League of Legends both saw a significant increase in viewership from the previous year’s events.Let’s have a look at the viewership numbers they received.League of Legends Worlds Championship 2022League of Legends is by far the most viewed esport globally. Worlds 2022 recorded a peak audience of 5.1 million during the 2022 League of Legends World Championship, breaking the previous viewership record for a League event, with 1.1 million more viewers than last year.Worlds 2022 is now the most-watched League of Legends tournament in the history of esports and the second most-watched esports event overall, following the Free Fire World Series in 2021.North America (USA and Mexico) hosted the tournament that started in October and culminated in the finals on November 5th. Two teams from South Korea T1, and DRX played out a five game series with underdog DRX emerging as the winner (3-2) in the final game. DRX ADC Deft defeated his old high school classmate Faker, becoming the oldest player to win a world championship at the age of 26. The MVP award went to DRX Toplaner Kingen.The presentation of the event underwent some upgrades and enhancements, leading to significantly more viewers than prior years events. The opening ceremony featured a live performance by Grammy-nominated American rapper and ‘President of League of Legends’ Lil Nas X. Notable personalities in attendance included the likes of mega influencer MrBeast (Jimmy Donaldson). More than 3.2 million viewers watched the ceremony alone, eclipsing the final as the second most-watched event of the competition.OWL Grand Finals 2022After a string of declining viewership numbers, the 2022 Overwatch League Playoffs were one of the most-watched events in the league’s history.Excluding Chinese viewers, Esports Charts reported that the OWL Grand Finals attracted a peak audience of 397k, with an average viewership of around 216k.The 2022 Grand Finals has the second-highest viewership of any event in the game’s history, behind only the 2018 regular season tournament. The boost is likely due to the October release of the long awaited free-to-play release of Overwatch 2.The 2022 Playoffs peak viewership more than doubled the 2021 Playoffs 134k viewers. With total hours watched coming in at a recorded 9.9 million hours compared to the previous year’s 2.57 million hours.The last match of the Overwatch League 2022 season was played between Dallas Fuel (Winners of the Summer Showdown Tournament) and the San Francisco Shock, who have the Alarm Rookie of the Year and MVP Kim (Proper) Dong-Hyun. The Dallas Fuel emerged victorious (4-3), in the final map of a nail biting series. Dallas Tank Lee (Fearless) Eui-Seok won the Grand Finals MVP as the Fuel won their first Overwatch League Championship." }, { "title": "Esports Weekend Recap: 5 Winners & 5 Losers (+1 BONUS)!", "url": "/posts/esports-weekend-recap-5-winners-5-losers-1-bonus/", "categories": "Esports, News", "tags": "fortnite, FNCS, Valorant, VCT, League of Legends, LCQ, Overwatch, OWL, Rust, Twitch Rivals, Rocket League, RCLS", "date": "2022-08-16 13:00:00 -0400", "snippet": "Last weekend had a plethora of esports events from the end of the Summer Split in League of Legends, the return of the Overwatch League, Last Chance Qualifiers for Valorant, FNCS Chapter 3 Season 3 in Fortnite, the Rocket League World Championship, a $100,000 Twitch Rivals tournament in Rust, and so much more. We’ll recap the 5 biggest winners and 5 biggest losers from the weekend. Buckle up, because it’s going to be a wild ride!Winner - EDGEdward Gaming became the first Chinese team to qualify for Valorant Champions and attend an international LAN event. EDG burst onto the East Asia Last Chance Qualifier (LCQ) scene, not dropping a match or even a map to secure their spot in Istanbul. Despite China not having its own VCT circuit, EDG blew its opponents out of the water with a mix of aggressive plays backed by solid fundamentals.While EDG’s Valorant fans will have to wait until September for Champions to start, a win last Wednesday over Anyone’s Legend locked EDG’s League of Legends team in 5th place going into the Summer Split playoffs. Fans can tune in this Thursday as the reigning world champions take on FPX.Loser - The GuardUnfortunately, the dream of Champions died for The Guard in a loss to 100 Thieves. The VCT Stage 1 Winners had a great run in the upper bracket, only dropping one map until the finals, where they were swept 3-0. With only third-party tournaments left for the year until franchising, The Guard fans will have to wait quite a while to see their team against the toughest competition.Unfortunately, their sister team the LA Gladiators had a similarly rough week. After winning the Midseason Madness Tournament, the Gladiators returned to regular season play dropping two 2-3 games to the Dallas Fuel and Houston Outlaws. They will hope to bounce back against the San Francisco Shock and Toronto Defiant next week.Winner - 100 ThievesOpposite The Guard, 100 Thieves earned a spot to Champions through the NA LCQ. After getting knocked into the lower bracket by Faze, the team would storm to finals through Sentinels, Cloud9, a Faze rematch, and end with a victory over The Guard to punch their ticket to Istanbul, only dropping a single map in the process. It helped that Derrek “Derrek” Ha won 16 clutches throughout their LCQ run. Fans will have to wait for September to see the squad in action again.Those who don’t want to wait can catch 100 Thieves League of Legends teams as they head into playoffs for the Summer Split. After going 2-1 in the last week of the regular season, the team locked up second place in the standings behind Evil Geniuses. They start in the second round of the winner’s bracket, waiting for the winner of Team Liquid vs FlyQuest. Fans can tune in on August 27th to watch the reigning LCS Champions try to repeat.Loser - DignitasA rough season for Dignitas’ League of Legends team came to a close last weekend as the team lost its last three games to end 3-15 for the split. The team had struggled throughout the split, but it was their last game that hit the hardest. Playing Golden Guardians, the team could force a tiebreaker game for playoffs if they won. Unfortunately, despite building a lead, Golden Guardians came back to crush Dignitas’ playoff dreams in a final fight over the Elder Dragon. It was especially painful losing at the hands of Golden Guardian’s most recent acquisition, Jungler Kim “River” Dong-woo, whom Dignitas had traded to Golden Guardians three weeks prior. Fans will have to wait till next year to see if Dignitas can bounce back from a rough year.Winner - Team LiquidTeam Liquid found success in both Riot-made games last weekend. The Team Liquid Valorant team won the EMEA LCQ, winning a finals revenge match against M3C. Although M3C squeaked out an overtime 2-1 in the upper bracket finals, Team Liquid beat G2 Esports in the lower bracket finals before winning the rematch with M3C 3-1. It helps when you have ScreaM going 91/60/12 KDA across the final four maps. They punch their ticket to Istanbul and will be back in action in September.In League of Legends, Team Liquid ended the regular season with a 2-1 week to lock up third place in the standings and send them into the playoffs. Widely regarded as an NA superteam, they will be back in action this Saturday against FlyQuest to fight for the LCS Championship and secure one of NA’s three slots for Worlds.Loser - VitalityOut of all the losers here, Vitality’s is perhaps the most unfortunate. The League of Legends team went into the last week of the regular season with a 94.6% chance to make the playoffs. Going against a 6-9 SK Gaming, 6-9 Fnatic, and 9-6 Rogue, the 9-6 Vitality, widely regarded as a European superteam initially, had to win a single match. They lost all three, forcing a tiebreaker game with Excel for the final playoff spot, which they also lost. Disappointed fans will have to wait for next year to see which direction the ex-superteam goes in.Winner - Cuhmmandment &amp; AveryIn an FNCS that came down to the final moments of the final game, Cuhmmandment and Avery pulled off the win. It seemed like a lost cause, as Mero11 and Bugha entered the last game with a large 20-point lead with Cuhmmandment and Avery in second. As the last game started, Mero11 and Bugha fell early, creating an opportunity for catchup, but Avery was lost early as well. This led to Cuhmmandment being alone and alone he secured enough kills and position points to sneak into first place. With one last kill with 10 players remaining, Cuhmmandment gave his duo the lead by one point! It was a nail-biter epic victory for $180,000 in prize money.Loser - Mero11 &amp; BughaOpposite Cuhmmandment and Avery, Mero11 and Bugha were on the losing side, missing the top spot by a single point. While they had entered the last game with a large lead and played cautiously, they were knocked out early. The players will have to wait for the next season for a chance at FNCS glory.Winner - Vancouver TitansThe Vancouver Titans picked up their first win this season as the Overwatch League returned. After picking up new head coach David “depi” Pei, the team showed signs of improvement last stage before heading into the Summer Showdown. After a close 2-3 loss to the Toronto Defiant, the Titans smashed the Paris Eternal 3-0 to get their first win of the season. Hopefully, the Titans can keep up their winning ways as they go against the New York Excelsior this Friday.Loser - xQcFour teams entered the Twitch Rivals $100,000 Rust tournament where only one could emerge victorious. Unfortunately for Team xQc, it wasn’t them. They fought hard over the course of the five-day tournament, avoiding elimination until the final day where they faced off against the other team left standing, Team DisguisedToast. Still, despite a $200k bet and intense effort, the points at the end of the day were a blowout as Team xQc posted 245 to Team DisguisedToast’s 518. The streamer will hopefully go again in the future if another Rust tournament occurs.BONUS - BDSBDS celebrated winning the Rocket League World Championship over the weekend. A dominant European force, the team is the undisputed best team in the world with a 4-1 win over G2 Esports. Despite bringing in a rookie this season with Enzo “Seikoo” Grondein and the related growing pains, the team overcame a variety of challenges to raise the trophy in Texas, with Seikoo being named the overall MVP for the event. BDS fans have a lot to celebrate with this victory - just don’t ask them how their League team is doing." }, { "title": "Are Esports A Sport?", "url": "/posts/are-esports-a-sport/", "categories": "Esports, Data Analytics", "tags": "esports news, esports earnings, professional gamers, are esports a sport, business of esports, are esports real sports", "date": "2022-07-26 13:00:00 -0400", "snippet": "Are esports real sports? Yes. Esports have emerged as one of the world’s fastest-growing sports—a digital arena where amateur and professional gamers vie for bragging rights.Esports Changed The Sports World; Now Data Is Changing EsportsThe first NBA three-pointer was made by Chris Ford of the Boston Celtics in a season opener that just so happened to be the debut of a player who’d go on to make 649 during his career: Larry Bird.The three pointer would go on to become critical to playing at a high level and winning games. In much the same way, artificial intelligence and machine learning are harnessing big data to help esports players make big performance improvements quickly.AI Supercharging Esports CompetitionForge, Omnic’s industry-first AI-based performance platform, allows gamers of all levels to take advantage of instant esports strategy tailored to style of play.Computer vision and machine learning have been used to analyze sports statistics for some years, but full-blown AI has stepped into the fray offering instant, independent and game-changing insights into player performance and putting wins in the bank.This development coincides with the exploding popularity of competitive esports. Viewership has bypassed that of the NFL and esports players earn big bucks. But, up to this point, coaches and players still lacked AI-driven player performance analytics.VALORANT Pushes Analytical BoundsUnlike mainstream sports, esports have less history to look back upon. For instance, Riot Games released VALORANT in June 2020 and quickly tallied 15-million players. In no time, teams competed for more than five-million dollars in both the 2020 and 2021 seasons.With that kind of money on the line, teams went looking for “competitive advantages generated from analytics,” says DeMars DeRover in his very interesting research paper, Winning Duels In VALORANT, A Visualization of Optimal Positioning.As DeRover says in his paper, “not all fights are created equal.” Advantage is achieved through player evaluation and player development that make victory more likely. The formula: identify player strengths and leverage them during gameplay. This includes character choice, tactics, weapon selection, and map positioning.In the end, especially when money is on the line, victory isn’t just about winning gunfights. It’s about communication, teamwork, and using character abilities as metrics that can help existing talent sharpen skills and new talent to stand out early in the process.Forge Is BornToward that end, the Forge AI platform was first concepted in 2018 as esports teams and leagues began forming along traditional sports models: franchises, drafts, recruitment, players unions and endorsement deals.For professional esports management and coaches, Forge adds consistency, strategy and execution to the game. Metrics like eye-tracking and twitch (also known as reaction time) can be tracked and analyzed. The programming code that makes up the Forge applies predictive analytics to gameplay videos, measuring performance and supplying actionable strategies to improve gameplay for teams and individuals.The future of esports will be data- and AI-driven just as the industry appears poised for continued growth. Before COVID-19 swept the globe, there were fewer than 50 colleges in the U.S. with an esports program. Today, there are more than 300, with many offering scholarships. Players are winning four, five, six, even seven figures in a single night.While many professional sports leagues took a financial hit during the pandemic, esports thrived. The growth gap created by the pandemic increased attention to endorsement deals and virtual ways of filling the financial gap.Boots On The GroundAll of which brings the focus back to what matters most: player performance.Forge analyzes thousands of factors at once. Some are map or position dependent, others the makeup of teams (employ more healers and other support roles or go heavy on attack damage specialists?).While we can’t list them all here, and nobody wants us to, Forge AI is tracking them all, turning them into actionable advice—the future for competitive esports players.Whether a professional esports athlete, an everyday player trying to break into the profession, or a manager looking to gain insight into team performance, Forge has the answers you seek." } ]
