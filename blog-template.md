You may have heard from your friends or teammates ingame that you need to improve your “**game sense**”. One of the major differences between great and bad players is their levels of situational awareness and the ability to solve complex scenarios. 

These skills commonly make up what players refer to as game sense.

Nearly all players want to improve their level of gameplay the best they can. Whether it is hitting the next rank or just playing with friends, there are a variety of options that players can choose. 

So how do I go about improving my game sense? Many argue that simply putting in hours and embracing the grind will put you well on your way. However, when playing the game you often don’t have time to analyze each and every decision you make, much less before you even make it. 

Recording and watching your own footage is a great way to track your progress and further analyze your gameplay. However, Omnic’s Forge™ can allow you to sit back and relax as it does it for you- all while extracting the important takeaways, saving you hours of time- in seconds. 

Applications like AimLabs or Kovaak may offer you ways to improve your raw aiming capabilities, however Omnic’s Forge™ presents users with a brand new way to improve their game sense. 

Omnic’s leading esports artificial intelligence analyzes performance using machine learning algorithms. Players create an account, upload video(s), and instantly receive customized coaching recommendations using Omnic's Forge™.

At Omnic we strive to help our players improve their video game skills by providing them with the information they need to succeed. For more information and to sign up, click below:
